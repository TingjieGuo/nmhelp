 MEANING: Functions that may be used in abbreviated code.
 CONTEXT: Fortran coded function

 A  series of built in probability density functions are available with
 NONMEM 7.4.2.  For a given probability density there is also a cumula-
 tive  distribution function (densitycdf), and random number generating
 function (density_rng).

 They are described in INTRODUCTION TO NONMEM 7.4.2 Section I.26.

 The density and densityCDF functions have arguments that are  compati-
 ble with the FUNC system, in which function provides derivatives (XD),
 and second derivatives (XDD) (see I.65.Expanded  Syntax  and  Capacity
 for  User-Defined  Functions  (FUNCA)  (NM74)). Thus, even random (eta
 associated) variables may serve as arguments to the parameters of  the
 density   functions.  The  source  code  of  these  densities  are  in
 ..\source\DISTRIB.f90, DISTRIBCDF.f90, and DISTRIBRNG.f90.  Note  that
 multi-variate densities do not have a corresponding CDF routine.

 Examples of their use are in the ..\examples\densities directory.

 Here  are  the  list  of densities, which are modeled after the format
 from the Stan manual:
