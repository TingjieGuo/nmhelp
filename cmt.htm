 MEANING:  Compartment  (CMT)  and  Prediction  Compartment (PCMT) data
 items for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 USAGE:
 $INPUT ... CMT PCMT ...

 DISCUSSION:
 CMT and PCMT label PREDPP's compartment (CMT) and prediction  compart-
 ment  (PCMT)  data  items.  The compartment and prediction compartment
 data items are optional.  They may be  used  separately  or  together.
 Their meanings depend on the particular kind of event record.

 Observation Event:
      CMT specifies the number of the observation compartment (the com-
      partment whose scaled drug amount appears as F in the error  rou-
      tine).  When this number is that of the output compartment, it is
      allowed to have a negative sign, in which case  the  output  com-
      partment is turned off after F is obtained.
      This  is also the case for an output-type compartment, which is a |
      compartment with attributes INITIALOFF and NODOSE.  (With a  com- |
      partment  n which is not the output compartment or an output-type |
      compartment, two records must be used, with the same TIME  value: |
      the  first  with  CMT=n and EVID=1 to obtain the observation, and |
      the second with CMT=-n and EVID=2 to turn the compartment off.)

      By convention, the number of the output compartment may  also  be |
      given  by  the  CMT  data  item  as the number 1000 (this is true |
      regardless of the type of the event record).  With  small  models |
      (number  of compartments &lt;= 99), this number may also be given as |
      100.  With versions of NONMEM prior to 7.3, only small models are |
      possible, and only 100 may be used.                               |

      When CMT is 0, the default compartment for observations is used.
      PCMT is ignored.

 Dose Event:
      CMT  specifies  the number of the compartment into which the dose
      is introduced.  The dose compartment is turned on if it was  pre-
      viously  off.   When  CMT is 0, the default compartment for doses
      receives the dose.
      PCMT specifies the number of the compartment for which an F value
      is computed.
      PCMT may be specified as 1000 or 100 to indicate the default com- |
      partment for output, similarly to CMT above.                      |
      When PCMT is 0, the default compartment for observations is used.

 Other-Type Event:
      A positive value of CMT specifies a compartment to be turned on.
      A negative value of CMT specifies a compartment to be turned off.
      When CMT is 0, no change is made in the status  of  any  compart-
      ment.
      PCMT is the same as for dose events.

 Reset Event:
      CMT is ignored.
      PCMT is the same as for dose events.

 Reset-Dose Event:
      CMT and PCMT are the same as for dose events.

 Guide  V  (Introductory Guide) has an example of how urine collections
 and observations of urine concentration can be described in  the  data
 file,  along  with observations of plasma concentrations.  See Chapter
 6, Section 9, The Output Compartment: Urine Collections  and  Observa-
 tions
