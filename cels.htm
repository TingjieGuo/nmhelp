 MEANING: CELS subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 This feature is not fully documented.  The interested user may be able
 to obtain more information by studying  the  appropriate  sections  of
 NONMEM  code and previous examples that may be available from advanced
 users.

 DISCUSSION:
 CELS is a NONMEM utility routine.  It may be called by a user-supplied
 CCONTR  routine.   It  computes the default contribution to the condi-
 tional objective function from a L2 record.

 Certain NONMEM error messages refer to CELS, for example:

 PROGRAM TERMINATED BY OBJ, ERROR IN CELS
 WITH INDIVIDUAL    1 (IN INDIVIDUAL RECORD ORDERING)
 INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIANCE OF DATA FROM OBS RECORD  1 ESTIMATED TO BE 0

 A common situation giving rise to this message is the use of a propor-
 tional   intra-individual  error  model  while  some predicted  values
 for  actual observations are zero or close to zero.  (For example,  if
 the  first dose is an infusion and there is  a  "base- line"  observa-
 tion  at  the start of the  infusion,  the  predicted  level  will  be
 zero.)

 CELS must not be called when a user-supplied CRIT routine is used.
