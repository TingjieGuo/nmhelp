 MEANING: SIGNAL program
 CONTEXT: NONMEM run

 Program  SIGNAL  is  a  NONMEM utility program.  It allows the user to
 send a signal to NONMEM while it is running.

 USAGE:
      signal X

 The following signals may be sent:

  Print toggle: J,R, or P
  Paraprint toggle: B,A, PA, or PP
  Next: K or N
  Stop: E or S
  Subject Print toggle: T, U, or SU

 DISCUSSION:

 Sometimes NONMEM does not respond to user  input  via  the  ctrl  key.
 This may occur during a parallel distribution run using MPI, or if the
 user began NONMEM with the -background  switch.   The  user  may  open
 another  console  window, copy the program signal.exe (signal in UNIX)
 from the NONMEM util directory to your run directory, then  enter  any
 one of these commands:

 Print toggle (monitor estimation progress):
 signal J
 signal R
 signal P

 Paraprint toggle (monitor parallel processing traffic):
 signal B
 signal A
 signal PA
 signal PP

 Next  (move  on  to next estimation mode or next estimation): signal K
 signal N

 Stop (end the present run cleanly):
 signal E
 signal S

 Subject print toggle:
 signal T
 signal U
 signal SU

 These create one of these files in the current (run) directory:
 sig.print
 sig.paraprint
 sig.next
 sig.stop
 sig.subject

 The multiple signals are synonyms.  For example, ctrl-T  is  the  key-
 board switch, so signal t should match this.  Also, since it is a sub-
 ject toggle, signal s or signal su are synonyms, suggesting Subject.

 The signal command creates the signal files, and  the  nonmem  program
 detects the signal file, and immediately deletes it.

 A  second  argument is permitted to specify the run directory, in case
 you are not executing the signal program from the run directory.
 signal N  /nonmem/
