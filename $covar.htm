 SAMPLE:
 $COVARIANCE

 DISCUSSION:
 Optional.  Requests  that  the  NONMEM Covariance Step be implemented.
 This step outputs: standard errors, covariance matrix, inverse covari-
 ance  matrix,  and the correlation form of the covariance matrix.  May
 also be coded $COVR.

 If $COV is specified, then for IMP, IMPMAP, and ITS methods,  standard
 error information will be supplied for every $EST statement.  Standard
 error information for the classical methods (METHOD=0, METHOD=1)  will
 be given only if they are the last estimation method, and only if NOF-
 COV is not specified.

 OPTIONS:

 SPECIAL
      The special computation will be used in the Covariance Step  with
      a recursive PRED subroutine.  A recursive PRED subroutine is such
      that, with single-subject data, the PRED computation with a  data
      record depends on information passed to it with any of the previ-
      ous data records.  This is the default when PREDPP is used.

 MATRIX=c
      Specifies that the covariance matrix will be different  from  the
      default  (R  sup  -1 S R sup -1).  MATRIX=R requests that 2 times
      the inverse R matrix be used.  MATRIX=S requests that 4 times the
      inverse  S  matrix be used.  (R and S are two matrices from  sta-
      tistical theory,  the Hessian and Cross-Product  Gradient  matri-
      ces,  respectively.)   With  MATRIX=R the standard errors will be |
      more consistent with other nonlinear regression  software  imple- |
      mentations.  MATRIX=R should not be used with option SPECIAL.
      MATRIX  has  no  relevance  to  the Covariance step results for a
      BAYES method.

 PRINT=[E][R][S]
      Additional outputs will be  printed  besides  the  defaults.   E:
      print  the  eigenvalues  of the correlation matrix.  R: print the
      matrix .5*R.  S: print the matrix .25*S.  PRINT=R (or S)  is  not
      needed with MATRIX=R (or S).

 COMPRESS
      Covariance  Step arrays are printed in compressed format, even if
      their size is such that NONMEM would normally print them  in  the
      usual format.

 SLOW Requests  a slower method of computation.  Required when either a
      mixture model was used along with CENTERING  on  the  $ESTIMATION
      record,  or NUMERICAL was used on the $ESTIMATION record.  If not
      present, the option will be automatically supplied in  these  two
      cases.

 NOSLOW
      Requests  a  faster  method  of computation.  This is the default
      (but see SLOW).                                                   |

 FAST (NM74)                                                            |
      This is equivalent to FAST for the $EST record.  record.  If $EST |
      FAST is set, then $COV will be set to FAST, unless SLOW or NOSLOW |
      is specified.

 TOL=n (NM72)
      Tolerance.  Used only with General Nonlinear (differential  equa-
      tion solver) ADVAN's. Sets NRD=TOL.  By default, the value set on
      $SUBROUTINES record (or $TOL or TOL subroutine) is used.  If  TOL
      is  coded  on  $COVARIANCE, it overides the default.  With NONMEM
      74, this feature is deprecated.  A user-supplied  TOL  subroutine
      should test NM_STEP and set NRD accordingly.
      TOL  has  no relevance to the Covariance step results for a BAYES
      method.

 ATOL=n (NM72)
      Absolute tolerance. Used only with ADVAN9, ADVAN13, ADVAN14,  and
      ADVAN15,  for  which TOL is a relative tolerance. Sets ANRD=ATOL.
      The default is 12 (that is, accuracy is 10**(-12)).  Usually  the
      problem  runs quickly when using this setting.  On occasion, how-
      ever, you may want to reduce ATOL (usually set it equal  to  that
      of TOL), and improve speeds of up to 3 to 4 fold.

      By  default, the value set on $SUBROUTINES record (or $TOL or TOL
      subroutine) is used.  If ATOL is coded on $ESTIMATION,  it  over-
      rides  the  default  for that step.  If ATOL is coded on $COVARI-
      ANCE, it overrides $ESTIMATION and/or the default for that  step.
      With  NONMEM 74, this feature is deprecated.  A user-supplied TOL
      subroutine should test NM_STEP and set ANRD accordingly.

 SIGL=n  SIGLO=n (NM72)
      These options may be used to specify  different  values  for  the
      Covariance step.  The step size for evaluating the R matrix (cen-
      tral difference second derivative) is set to SIGL/4.  If only the
      S  matrix is evaluated (central difference first derivative), the
      step size is set to SIGL/3.  SIGLO  is  the  precision  to  which
      individual  etas are optimized.  Classical NONMEM methods in par-
      ticular often require a different  significant  digits  level  of
      evaluation  (usually  more  stringent) during the Covariance step
      than during Estimation Step.  For example, during the  Estimation
      step,  NSIG=2,  SIGL=6,  TOL=6  may be sufficient, but during the
      Covariance step, you may need SIGL=12 TOL=12  to  avoid  positive
      definiteness issues.
      By default, values specified on the $ESTIMATION record are used.
      (See <A HREF="$.htm#$estimation">$ESTIMATION</A>).
      SIGL  and  SIGLO have no relevance to the Covariance step results
      for a BAYES method.

 NOFCOV (NM72)
      No $COV step for any classical estimation steps.  This  would  be
      useful  if  you  wanted  EM  estimation analyses performed, and a
      final FOCE analysis performed, but did not want  the  program  to
      spend time on standard error assessments for FOCE, which can take
      a long time relative to the other methods.

 PARAFILE=filename
      Name of the "parallel file" (the  parallelization  profile)  that
      controls  parallelization  (distributed computing).  Default file
      name if not specified: parallel.pnm or parafile name specified on
      nmfe command.
      PARAFILE=ON turns on parallelization for this $COVARIANCE record.
      PARAFILE=OFF  turns  off  parallelization  for  this  $COVARIANCE
      record.

 PARAFPRINT=n (NM74)
      The print iteration intervals to the parallelization log file can
      be  controlled  by this option during parallelization of the $COV
      step.  See also <A HREF="$.htm#$estimation">$ESTIMATION</A> record and nmfe74  command.   Default
      is PARAFPRINT=1.

 THBND=n (NM74)
      By  default  (THBND=0),  any  theta  boundaries  specified in the
      $THETA record causes NONMEM to impose a non-linear transformation
      of  the  theta  parameters so that the transformed parameters may
      vary from -infinity to  infinity.  It  does  this  with  logistic
      transformations.   This  is  suitable during the estimation step,
      but it may be desirable to turn this off for  covariance  assess-
      ment,  and  assess  partial derivatives of the objective function
      with respect to the thetas themselves, or some linear transforma-
      tion  of  these  thetas.  Set  THBND=1 to do this. If no lower or
      upper bounds are given to thetas in $THETA  record,  this  option
      has no impact.

 SIRSAMPLE=n (NM74)
      Option   SIRSAMPLE  requests  the  Sampling-Importance-Resampling
      algorithm (SIR) (See NONMEM 74 Guide, "Importance Sampling of the
      Variance-Covariance  of  the  Parameter  Estimates").  By default
      SIRSAMPLE=-1, so SIR process does not occur.  SIRSAMPLE should be
      set  between 300 and 10000, to indicate the number of random sam-
      ples to be generated.  This  will  produce  SIRSAMPLE  importance
      samples,  each  of  which  will be placed in the raw output file.
      Utility programs table_quant (frequency and quantile sorting) and
      table_resample (resampling) may be used to analyze $COV Sampling-
      Importance-Resampling data.

 SIRNITER=n (NM74)
      The number of times SIR sampling should occur.  Default is 1.

 SIRCENTER=n (NM74)
      Where the sampling (proposal) density is to be centered.  On  the
      first iteration, the mean of the sampling density is at the esti-
      mate.  On subsequent iterations, the mean of the sampling density
      is  at  the  estimate (SIRCENTER=0) or at the mean of the (trans-
      formed) samples of the previous iteration (SIRSAMPLE=1).  Default
      is 0.

 IACCEPT=n (NM74)
      The  acceptance ratio acts similarly to importance sampling in EM
      analysis.  Default is 1.

 IACCEPTL=n (NM74)
      IACCEPTL=0 (NM74) Default is 1.  The IACCEPTL option performs the
      same  as  listed for IACCEPTL in "Monte Carlo Importance Sampling
      EM".  Default is 0.

 SIRDF=n (NM74)
      The proposal density is to be a t distribution with n degrees  of
      freedom.  Default is 0, a normal density.

 RANMETHOD=[n|S|m|P] (NM74)
      See the corresponding option of the <A HREF="$.htm#$estimation">$ESTIMATION</A> record for impor-
      tance sampling in EM analysis.

 SIRPRINT=n (NM74)
      Set the console print iterations interval. This does  not  impact
      the  iterations  listed  in  the  raw  output file.  Default SIR-
      PRINT=0.

 FILE=filename (NM74)
      By default, the raw output file is whatever  was  listed  in  the
      $EST  step,  or root.ext, where root is the root name of the con-
      trol stream file. You can re-direct SIR  sample  listings  to  an
      alternative file with this option.

 FORMAT=s (NM74)
      By  default, the raw output file format is whatever was listed in |
      the $EST step, or s1PE12.5.  You can change its format  with  the
      above option.

 SIRTHBND=n (NM74)
      As  with the deterministic covariance assessment step, by default
      the transformed parameters are sampled,  so  that  no  sample  is
      below  the  $THETA  lower bound specification, and no higher than
      the $THETA upper bound specification.  To  allow  a  boundariless
      search  in  the original theta domain, set SIRTHBND=1. You should
      also set THBND=1, so that the deterministc covariance matrix used
      as  the proposal density is also not hindered or contorted by the
      boundaries.  Default is the value of THBND, which in turn is 0 by
      default.

 PRECOND=n (NM74)
      Options PRECOND through PRETYPE affect the preconditioning of the
      R Matrix (See the NONMEM 74 Guide, "Preconditioning the R  Matrix
      to  Improve  Precision  and  Success  Rate  of  $COV  Step").  By
      default, PRECOND (Preconditioning cycles") is 0, and no precondi-
      tioning of the R matrix is performed.  When PRECOND=n, then up to
      n preconditioning cycles are performed.  This is used in combina-
      tion with the PFCOND setting.

 PRECONDS=TOS (NM74)
      By default, if preconditioning is performed, it is done on Thetas
      (T), Omegas (O), and Sigmas(S). Specify PRECONDS (Preconditioning
      types)=T  to  do  only  thetas, PRECONDS=TO to do only thetas and
      omegas, etc.

 PFCON=n (NM74)
      PFCOND means 'forced' precondition cycles. Preconditioning occurs
      exactly PFCOND times, without testing if the R matrix is positive
      definite or not on each preconditioning cycle. On  the  remaining
      PRECOND-PFCOND  cycles, the R matrix is tested for positive defi-
      niteness, and upon success, will  terminate  the  preconditioning
      cycles.  Default is PFCOND=0.

 PRETYPE=n (NM74)
      By  default PRETYPE(preconditioning type)=0 and the R matrix cor-
      rector is V*square_root(eigenvalue). If you set  PRETYPE=1,  then
      the corrector is V*square_root(eigenvalue)*Vtranspose. If you set
      PRETYPE=2, then the corrector is the correlation version of  PRE-
      TYPE=1.

 FPOSDEF=n (NM74)
      By  default  FPOSDEF(forced  positive definite)=0.  If FPOSDEF=1,
      then if the Rmatrix is not positive definite, it will  be  forced
      positive  definite.  If PRECOND&gt;0, this will occur after the PRE-
      CONDth try.

 CHOLROFF=n (NM74)
      If CHOLROFF is set to 1, then one part of the R matrix evaluation
      will  be  evaluated  in the manner of earlier versions of NONMEM.
      This is strictly for comparison with earlier versions  for  diag-
      nostic purposes.  Default is 0.

 KNUTHSUMOFF=n (NM74)
      In NONMEM 7.4, the Knuth summing method is used to allow the most
      accurate summation of individual objective function values,  even
      with large variations in values of the individual objective func-
      tion.  To turn this off, and allow a standard summation (not rec-
      ommended  except  for comparison purposes from earlier versions),
      set KNUTHSUMOFF=1. If KNUTHSUMOFF was set in the $EST  step,  but
      not  in  the  $COV  step,  the KNUTHSUMOFF value of the last $EST
      record will be used.  Default is 0.

 CONDITIONAL
      The Covariance Step is implemented, but only when the  Estimation
      Step  terminates  successfully (in this run or in a run continued
      via $MSFI).  This is the default.

 UNCONDITIONAL
      The Covariance Step is implemented regardless of how the  Estima-
      tion  Step  terminates  (in  this  run  or in a run continued via
      $MSFI).

 RESUME (NM73)
      If MSFO=msfile was specified  in  the  Estimation  Step  for  the
      FO/FOCE/Laplace  method  and  analysis was interrupted during the
      Covariance Step, then the Covariance Step may be resumed where it
      was interrupted in a subsequent problem.  Use the $MSFI record to
      specify the MSFO file of the interrupted analysis, and the RESUME
      option of the $COV record:

      $MSFI=msfile
       ...
      $COV RESUME

 OMITTED
      The Covariance Step is not implemented.
