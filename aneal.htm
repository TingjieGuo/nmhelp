 MEANING: CONSTRAINT subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 USAGE:
      $SUBROUTINES ADVAN3 TRANS4 OTHER=aneal.f90

 DISCUSSION:

 Additional  algorithmic  constraints  may  be  imposed  upon the model
 parameters, by use of the  subroutine  CONSTRAINT.   This  feature  is
 available only for the EM and Bayesian algorithms.

 One  use  would  be to slow the rate of reduction of the diagonal ele-
 ments of the OMEGA values during the burn-in phase of the SAEM method.
 This  is shown in example 9, where a user supplied annealing algorithm
 is used to replace the built-in one described earlier.  By  specifying
 OTHER=ANEAL.f90,  where  ANEAL.f90  was originally derived from a tem-
 plate of CONSTRAINT.f90 in the source  directory,  the  user  supplied
 CONSTRAINT subroutine can be incorporated into the model.

 In example 9, whenever the argument iteration number (ITER_NO) of CON-
 STRAINT changes, a new OMEGA is evaluated that is larger than what was
 determined  by  the  SAEM update.  Typically, this expansion algorithm
 should be such that its impact decreases with  each  iteration.   This
 example is given in example 9.
