 MEANING: DOEXPAND program
 CONTEXT: NONMEM run

 USAGE:

 ..\util\doexpand  &lt; original.ctl &gt; new.ctl

 DISCUSSION:
 With  NONMEM  7.4,  The utility program doexpand augments  abbreviated
 code in an NM-TRAN control stream file that has  been  annotated  with
 DOE  (which  stands  for DO expand) and ENDDOE (which stands for ENDDO
 expand) directives. This is useful for repetitive code statements that
 differ  only  by increments of indices.  For example, it is useful for
 replicating derivative equations that differ only by their indices  to
 DADT()  and  A(). These may occur with time delay and transit compart-
 ment differential equations.
