</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>data set</b> consists of
a sequence of <b>data records,</b> essentially one for each
different observation (although see the discussion below
about data records with missing dependent variable data
items). A data record, in turn, is a sequence of <b>data
items</b> (the same number of data items in each data
record). One of these data items is the associated
observation, also called <b>the dependent variable (DV) data
item.</b> The other data items in the data record may be
loosely regarded as specific items needed to predict the DV
data item under the user-specified statistical model. The
data items of each data record are placed on a number of
contiguous FORTAN records, and this set of FORTRAN records
is read by NONMEM as a unit, i.e. with a single I/O list,
under a user-supplied FORTRAN format specification. The
format specification may consist of E, F, and X format
codes. An I code is not allowed. For example there may be
nine data items per data record, and these may be
distributed over two FORTRAN records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example B.1.i:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2 3.6 4.7 .27E01 Record 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0.5 9.8 6.5 .12E00 3 Record
2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and read with the format
specification (3(F3.1,2X),E6.2/3(F3.1,2X),E6.2,2X,F1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In NONMEM the data records with
DV data items associated with a given individual are grouped
together. This is accomplished in part by including in each
data record a data item identifying the individual with
which the DV data item in the record is associated. This
data item is called <b>the identification (ID) data
item.</b> An ID data must always appear in the data record,
except when every data record would ordinarily have a
<b>different</b> ID data item, in which case the ID data
items are not necessary. In the above example the ninth data
item might be the ID data item, although there is no
requirement that the ID data item be integer-valued. The
grouping of the data records is acomplished by including ID
data items in the data records <b>and</b> by arranging that
all data records with the same ID data item be contiguous in
the data set. Two or more data records are understood to be
contiguous if the sets of FORTRAN records on which the data
items of these data records are placed (one set of FORTAN
records per data record) occur contiguously in the data
file. The data records with the same ID data item are
collectively called <b>an individual record.</b> This ID
data item is also called <b>the ID data item of the
individual record.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ID data items can be constructed
with a little more flexibility than indicated above. The ID
data item of an individual record A must differ from that of
the following individual record B. However, it can be the
same as the ID data item of the individual record following
B. The rule is that only the two ID data items of two
contiguous individual records must differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned in section A.5,
when the statistical model has non-nested random effects,
the observations are regarded as arising from different
individuals, even if, indeed, they do not. The observations
in simple nonlinear regression models, for example, are so
regarded. In this situation each data record containing an
observation should be contained in a different individual
record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data records may be designated
as missing DV data items. Such records are useful for a
variety of reasons. For example, suppose that the prediction
of the DV data item depends on the value of time, another
data item in the data record. Suppose also that one wants to
plot predictions vs time, and for this purpose, one wants to
develop predictions at time points other than those for
which there correspond DV data items in the data set. One
can construct additional data records with these time points
and designate them as missing DV data items. Predictions
will be generated for these data records, and these
predictions can appear in tables and be used in
scatterplots. There will be DV data items on these records,
but they will be &quot;dummy&quot; items. The user can let
them be zero or any other value(s). NONMEM will not use the
DV data items on these records - not for the purpose of
estimation. However, all data items on all records will be
used for the purpose of constructing tables. For the purpose
of constructing a scatterplot where one of the axes of the
plot corresponds to the DV data item, or the residual data
item, or the weighted residual data item, data records
designated as missing the DV data item are not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are to be data records
designated as missing DV data items, then all data records
must have a <b>missing DV (MDV) data item.</b> A MDV data
item must be either zero or one. A zero MDV data item means
that the DV data item in the record is not missing; a one
means that it is missing. If there are MDV data items, there
must also be ID data items (even if there is but one data
record in each individual record). A data record with MDV
data item equal to zero is called an <b>observation
record.</b> When there are no MDV data items in the data
set, all data records are observation records. An individual
record need not have any observation records; that is, it
may be comprised only of data records designated as missing
DV data items.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a model with one-level nested
random effects there are random interindividual effects, and
nested within them, there are random intraindividual
effects. The random interindividual effects may be called
<b>random level-one effects,</b> and the random
intraindividual effects may be called <b>random level-two
effects.</b> (There are two levels of random effects,
<b>but</b> there is only one level of nesting.) In a
statistical model for the DV data items, the values of
random level-one effects are different only for DV data
items in different individual records. The ID data items are
used to group data records into individual records. The ID
data item is also called <b>the level-one (L1) data
item,</b> and an individual record is also called a
<b>level-one record.</b> Now suppose that multivariate
observations are obtained from each of a number of
individuals. In the statistical model the values of random
level-two effects are different only for DV data items that
are elements of different observations. (If all observations
are univariate, the values of random level-two effects are
different for all DV data items.) Therefore, when there are
multivariate observations modeled with one-level nested
random effects, another type of data item must be used to
group data records according to the observations with which
their DV data items are associated. This data item is called
<b>the level-two (L2) data item.</b> The grouping of the
data records by observation is accomplished by including L2
data items in the data records <b>and</b> by arranging that
all data records related by the same L2 data item be
contiguous in the data set. The data records related by the
same L2 data item are collectively called a <b>level-two
record.</b> This L2 data item is also called <b>the L2 data
item of the level-two record.</b> Obviously, a level-two
record should be totally contained within a level-one
record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L2 data items can be constructed
with a little more flexibility than indicated above. The L2
data item of a level-two record A must differ from that of
the following level-two record B. However, it can be the
same as the L2 data item of the level-two record following
B. The rule is that only the two L2 data items of two
contiguous level-two records must differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DV, ID, MDV, and L2 data
items are the data items in the data set that are of
particular concern to NONMEM, and they are called the
<b>NONMEM data items.</b> Other data items in the data set
are of concern only to user-supplied subprograms.</p>

<h2>B.2. Control Records
<a name="2."></a>
<a name="2. Control Records"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>control records</b>
contain the instructions to NONMEM. The sequence of control
records is called the <b>control stream.</b> Each control
record is comprised of one or more FORTRAN 80 character
records. All control records begin with a 4 character
preface such as ESTM, SCAT, and THTA (abbreviating
ESTIMATION, SCATTERPLOT, and THETA, respectively). The
fields on a control record begin in position 9, except where
noted otherwise. If a control record needs to be continued
on more than one FORTRAN record, the fields on each of the
continuation records begin in position 9 also, and the first
8 positions are left blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example B.2.i:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some control records have only
one field, 72 characters long, in which a character string
is placed. Such records are said to have <b>character
format.</b> They cannot be continued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example B.2.ii</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most control records have
one or more 4 character fields in which integers are placed.
These integers are to be right-adjusted in the fields. This
type of control record has at most 18 fields per FORTRAN
record. Such records are said to have <b>integer
format.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example
B.2.iii:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some control records,
like that in Example B.2.i above, have one or more 8
character fields in which FORTRAN fixed point numbers are
placed. This type of control record has at most 9 fields per
FORTRAN record. Such records are said to have <b>fixed point
format.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are 21 functional types of
control records, as listed in Table B.2.i. However, many of
these are optional.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">Table B.2.i
Control Record Types</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-188723.png" alt="Image grohtml-188723.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The record types are divided
into five major groups. The first group is comprised of the
FILE and PROBLEM records. The second group is comprised of
the <b>data set specification records;</b> these records
define the characteristics of the data set. The third group
is comprised of the <b>model specification records;</b>
these records, along with the user-supplied subroutine PRED,
define the simulation/data-analytic model. The fourth group
is comprised of the <b>initial estimate records;</b> these
records give the initial parameter estimates, or information
that can be used to obtain these estimates. They also may
contain information that can be used to obtain final
parameter estimates. The fifth group is comprised of the
<b>task specification records;</b> these records define the
tasks that are to be implemented in order to
simulate/analyze the data.</p>

<h2>B.3. File Records
<a name="3."></a>
<a name="3. File Records"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control stream is stored in
a file. There are other files used by NONMEM (for a complete
listing of these see NONMEM Users Guide III). For example,
the data set can be stored in a separate file. (The data set
can also be &quot;embedded in the control stream&quot;, in
which case it is effectively stored in the file containing
the control stream.) The file mentioned in point v of
section A.3 is another example. It is called a <b>Model
Specification File.</b> Each of these two examples is an
example of a file that exists at the user&rsquo;s option
(unlike the file containing the control stream) and that
must be opened by NONMEM itself, i.e. instructions to open
the file must be given to NONMEM. This type of a file is
called an <b>optional NONMEM file.</b> (There may be files
that are opened by user-supplied subroutines. These are
regarded differently. For discussion of these see NONMEM
Users Guide, Part II.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>file records</b> contain
the instructions to open the optional NONMEM files. The
sequence of file records is called the <b>file stream.</b>
Each file record is formatted exactly like a
character-formatted control record (see above), with the
exception of the problem delimiter record. The name of a
file is placed in the character field (left adjusted). There
are 4 functional types of file records, as listed in Table
B.3.i.</p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em">Table B.3.i File
Record Types</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-188724.png" alt="Image grohtml-188724.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these records are optional.
They may occur in any order, with the one exception that
when a MODEL SPECIFICATION FILE INPUT record and MODEL
SPECIFICATION FILE OUTPUT record both occur for the same
problem, the latter must preceed the former. There can be
only one file record of each type per problem. The file
records for any one problem must be followed by a problem
delimiter record, i.e. a record consisting of asterisks in
positions 1-4. If there are no file records with a problem,
only the problem delimiter record should appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the data set is contained
in a separate file, the name of this file is placed in the
field of the DATA record. A Model Specification File occurs
in two ways, as a file to be input when continuing a search,
and as a file to be output to allow a search to be continued
later. The MODEL SPECIFICATION FILE INPUT record and the
MODEL SPECIFICATION FILE OUTPUT record correspond to these
two files; the name of the file is placed in the field of
the corresponding record. Each table generated in a given
problem may be stored in a common file called a <b>Table
File</b> The name of the Table File is placed in the field
of the TABLE record.</p>
