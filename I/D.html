<h2>D.1. Introduction

<a name="1. Introduction"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this chapter the example
discussed in chapter C is elaborated in order to begin
illustrating the large variety of modeling possibilities
using NONMEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statistical model considered
in chapter C has exactly one random effect. As such, it is a
particular example of a class of regression models with
possibly more than one random effect and where no random
effect is nested within any of the others. An example of
such a model, again a nonlinear regression model with just
one random effect, but which does not have the simple error
structure of the example of chapter C, is discussed in
sections D.2 and D.3. Another example with two random
effects is discussed in sections D.4 and D.5.</p>

<h2>D.2. Example with One Random Effect
<a name="2."></a>
<a name="2. Example with One Random Effect"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">In recent years a variant of the
statistical model discussed in chapter C has been found
useful in kinetic situations. Let
<img src="grohtml-19414-3.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-3.png">
, and let</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194143.png" alt="Image grohtml-194143.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194144.png" alt="Image grohtml-194144.png"></p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194145.png" alt="Image grohtml-194145.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and f is as in chapter C. Again,
there is only one random effect,
<img src="grohtml-19414-7.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-7.png">
, whose values for the observations in the data set, the
<img src="grohtml-19414-8.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-8.png">
, are statistically independent random errors with means 0
and commmon variance
<img src="grohtml-19414-9.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-9.png">
. However, with this model</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194146.png" alt="Image grohtml-194146.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.e. the variances of the
<img src="grohtml-19414-11.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-11.png">
are proportional to an (unknown) power of the mean values of
the
<img src="grohtml-19414-12.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-12.png">
. If
<img src="grohtml-19414-13.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-13.png">
, the model reduces to the simple nonlinear regression
model. If
<img src="grohtml-19414-14.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-14.png">
, the coefficient of variation of the
<img src="grohtml-19414-15.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-15.png">
is constant across i, viz.
<img src="grohtml-19414-16.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-16.png">
. In order to implement this model it is important to note
that in the expression for this model the random effect
occurs linearly and that its coefficient is a value of a
function g evaluated at
<img src="grohtml-19414-17.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-17.png">
; see section D.3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ELS objective function with
this model is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194147.png" alt="Image grohtml-194147.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The efficacy of using this
objective function with this model is discussed in Sheiner
and Beal, 1985 and Beal and Sheiner, 1988. The objective
function can also be written</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194148.png" alt="Image grohtml-194148.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quantity in square brackets
being squared is the <b>weighted residual from
<img src="grohtml-19414-20.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-20.png">
,</b> the residual divided by its standard deviation. The
<b>weighted residuals</b> are defined as the weighted
residuals from all observations
<img src="grohtml-19414-21.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-21.png">
.</p>

<h2>D.3. Implementation of Example 1
<a name="3."></a>
<a name="3. Implementation of Example 1"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A code for PRED which implements
the example is given in Fig. 36. The only difference between
this code and the code in Fig. 1 is the value that is
returned in G(1). In the earlier code, the value is
uniformly equal to 1. In this code the value
<img src="grohtml-19414-22.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-22.png">
is returned. (This value is uniformly equal to 1 only when
<img src="grohtml-19414-23.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-23.png">
is fixed to 0.) In general, the Ith linear coefficient of
the Ith random interindividual effect is returned in G(I).
Here, though, there is only one random interindividual
effect in the model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A control stream for this
example is given in Fig. 37. The essential difference
between it and the one in Fig. 2 is that it specifies that
there are 4
<img src="grohtml-19414-24.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-24.png">
, rather than 3. The initial estimate of
<img src="grohtml-19414-25.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-25.png">
is unspecified, but is constrained to be between 0 and 3
(see section C.4.5). Also, this control stream specifies
that a plot of weighted residual vs time be obtained, rather
than specify that a plot of residual vs time be
obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The minimum value of the
objective function is computed to be 8.778, not really
different from that obtained with the simple nonlinear
regression, 8.940. The final estimates of the parameters of
the regression function are also only a little different:
<img src="grohtml-19414-26.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-26.png">
(vs 1.94),
<img src="grohtml-19414-27.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-27.png">
(vs .102),
<img src="grohtml-19414-28.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-28.png">
(vs 32). The estimate of
<img src="grohtml-19414-29.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-29.png">
is .45, so that the variances of the
<img src="grohtml-19414-30.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-30.png">
are estimated to be approximately proportional to the
<img src="grohtml-19414-31.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-31.png">
. However, the imprecision in this estimate is large (the
standard error estimate is about 400% of the point
estimate), and the presence of this parameter in the model
is only to provide robustness in the presence of possible
heteroscedasticity (Beal and Sheiner, 1988). The plot of
weighted residual vs time is also very similar to the
earlier plot of residual vs time.</p>

<h2>D.4. Example with Two Random Effects
<a name="4."></a>
<a name="4. Example with Two Random Effects"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example is very similar to
the one given in chapter C. An oral dose of theophylline is
administered to a single subject, but at various times both
plasma <b>and</b> saliva concentrations are measured. At
some times only plasma concentration or only saliva
concentrations are measured. Therefore, there will be two
types of observations in the data set. The regression
function for the plasma concentrations is taken to be the
&quot;one-compartment model without absorption&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-194149.png" alt="Image grohtml-194149.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because although an oral dose
was administered, the observations were taken after the
absorption phase of the process was effectively over, and
only an exponential elimination phase was in progress. The
regression function for the saliva concentrations is taken
to be</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-1941410.png" alt="Image grohtml-1941410.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, the predicted saliva
concentration is modeled to be proportional to the predicted
plasma concentration. These two models can be combined into
a single regression function as follows.</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-1941411.png" alt="Image grohtml-1941411.png"></p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-1941412.png" alt="Image grohtml-1941412.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where
<img src="grohtml-19414-36.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-36.png">
is the plasma-saliva indicator variable (it has the value 0
if the observation is a plasma concentration, and the value
1 if the observation is a saliva concentration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the statistical model the
observations are doubly subscripted:
<img src="grohtml-19414-37.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-37.png">
is the jth observation from the ith time point. When both
plasma and saliva are measured, j assumes the values 1 and
2. When only plasma or only saliva is measured, j assumes
the value 1. The statistical model is given by</p>


<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-1941413.png" alt="Image grohtml-1941413.png"></p>

are values of the independent variables associated with

<img src="grohtml-19414-43.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-43.png">
are statistically independent random error vectors with 0
means and common variance-covariance matrix
<img src="grohtml-19414-44.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-44.png">
. This
<img src="grohtml-19414-45.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-45.png">
matrix is another model parameter to be estimated. It
contains two possibly different variance components, one
corresponding to plasma concentrations and one corresponding
to saliva concentrations, since each type of concentration
is measured with a possibly different scale. It also
contains a covariance component since we wish to account for
the possibility that when the two types of concentrations
are measured at the same time point, these measurements
(after adjustment for the fixed effects of time and dose)
may be statistically correlated. Under the model, when both
the observations
<img src="grohtml-19414-46.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-46.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-19414-47.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-47.png">
are present at the ith time point, since one of them is
affected by
<img src="grohtml-19414-48.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-48.png">
and the other is affected by
<img src="grohtml-19414-49.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-49.png">
, and since these random effects can covary, so then can the
two observations. The two observations together,
<img src="grohtml-19414-50.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-50.png">
, therefore, form a multivariate observation. We let
<img src="grohtml-19414-51.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-51.png">
denote the column form of this vector. When only one
observation is present at the ith time point, then
<img src="grohtml-19414-52.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-52.png">
denotes this single number. There is no nesting of the two
random effects. Therefore, they both are treated as random
interindividual effects, and as with simple nonlinear
regression, the observation vectors
<img src="grohtml-19414-53.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-53.png">
are regarded as coming from different individuals (see
section A.5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The model can be rewritten</p>

, where the coefficients are given as g&rsquo;s, is similar
to the way the model of section D.2 is expressed, and it is
called the <b>NONMEM linear model schematic.</b> The term
&rsquo;linear&rsquo; here refers to linearly occuring random
effects and not to linearly ocurring parameters. By virtue
of the observation vector being multivariate at some time
points, this model is a type of multivariate nonlinear
regression. The absence of a plasma or saliva measurement at
some time point makes the situation unbalanced, or from
another point of view, there are missing data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A code for PRED which implements
the example is given in Fig. 38. Note that the values
<img src="grohtml-19414-74.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-74.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-19414-75.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-75.png">
are returned in G(1) and G(2), respectively. As with the
previous example, these are the coefficients of
<img src="grohtml-19414-76.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-76.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-19414-77.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-77.png">
in the NONMEM linear model schematic. In general, the value
returned in G(I) is the coefficient of the Ith random
interindividual effect in the NONMEM linear model
schematic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A control stream for this
example is given in Fig. 39. The data set is embedded in it,
and like the data of the previous example, the first,
second, and third data items in a data record are the dose,
time, and DV data items, respectively. However, there is
also a fourth type of data item, the plasma-saliva indicator
data item. This is labeled P/S. The DV data item is either a
plasma concentration or a saliva concentration, according as
the P/S data item is 0 or 1, respectively. Since all
observation vectors are regarded as arising from different
individuals (see section D.4), and since some observation
vectors contain two elements, a plasma and a saliva
concentration, ID data items must be present in the data
records. These will assure that both elements are identified
with the same individual. Since the individual changes as
time changes, the time data item has been chosen to serve as
the ID data item. Therefore, a 2 appears in field 1 of the
ITEM record. A separate fifth type of data item could have
been used for the ID data item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control stream contains a
new model specification record, the STRUCTURE record for
<img src="grohtml-19414-78.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-78.png">
, which is discussed in section D.5.2. It also contains a
new initial estimate record, the BLOCK SET record for
<img src="grohtml-19414-79.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-79.png">
which is discussed in section D.5.3. Also, sort codes appear
for the first time in the TABLE record, and separators
appear for the first time in the SCATTERPLOT records. These
are discussed in sections D.5.4 and D.5.5. Selected printout
which results from using the PRED and the control stream
given in Figs. 38 and 39, respectively, is discussed in
section D.5.6.</p>

<a name="5.2. STRUCTURE Record for OMEGA"></a>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two STRUCTURE records
in Fig. 39, the initial STRUCTURE record and the STRUCTURE
record for
<img src="grohtml-19414-80.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-80.png">
. Regarding the first of these, since there are now 2 random
interindividual effects, a 2 is placed in field 2. The
matrix
<img src="grohtml-19414-81.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-81.png">
could be constrained to be diagonal, in which case a 1 is
again placed in field 6. However, for the sake of this
example, no such constraint is wanted. Therefore, instead, a
1 is placed in field 7. This signals that
<img src="grohtml-19414-82.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-82.png">
is to be regarded as a full matrix. Another option is to
regard
<img src="grohtml-19414-83.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-83.png">
as a block diagonal matrix, in which case yet another value
is placed in field 7; see NONMEM Users Guide, Part II.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a 1 is placed in field 7 of
the initial STRUCTURE record, i.e. when
<img src="grohtml-19414-84.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-84.png">
is not constrained to be diagonal, the most number of random
interindividual effects there can be is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a 1 is placed in field 7 of
the initial STRUCTURE record, the STRUCTURE record for
<img src="grohtml-19414-85.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-85.png">
must appear after the initial STRUCTURE record. Integer
format is used. When a 1, in particular, is placed in field
7 of the initial STRUCTURE record, a 1 is placed in field 1
of the STRUCTURE record for
<img src="grohtml-19414-86.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-86.png">
, and the number of random interindividual random effects is
placed in field 2. The information in this record is
redundant in this example; it is already given in the
initial STRUCTURE record. The requirement that the record
appears is related to the possiblility just mentioned that
<img src="grohtml-19414-87.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-87.png">
can be block diagonal, and in this case the information
contained in the record is not redundant.</p>

situation that gives rise to the terminology &rsquo;BLOCK
SET&rsquo; (see NONMEM Users Guide, Part II). Fixed point
format is used. The initial estimates are placed in the
fields in the following order:

is to be fixed to these initial estimates, then in addition,
a 1 is placed in position 8 of the record. In the BLOCK SET
record of Fig. 39, a 2 appears in position 8, and the fields
are left blank, indicating that NONMEM is to obtain the
initial estimates. When one field is left blank, all fields

<h2>D.5.4. Sorting in Tables
<a name="5.4."></a>
<a name="5.4. Sorting in Tables"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">As mentioned in section C.3.5.3,
rows of tables may be sorted on the data items in specified
columns. There is some reason for utilizing this feature in
the example, namely, to separate the rows with plasma
concentration DV data items from those with saliva
concentration DV data items. This separation may be done by
selecting the P/S data items for tabulation and by
indicating that the rows of the table are to be sorted
firstly on these data items. Then the first rows will
contain only P/S data items equal to 0, and the last rows
will contain only P/S data items equal to 1. The sorting is
indicated by a 1 placed in the sort field following the
field containing the index of the P/S data items.
Accordingly, in the individual TABLE record in Fig. 39,
field 4 contains the index of the P/S data items, and a 1 is
placed in the following field. There are 2 types of data
items selected for tabulation (note the 2 in field 1), the
P/S data items and the time data items. Since it is also
useful to sort the rows with plasma concentration DV data
items on their time data items, and to sort the rows with
saliva concentration DV data items on their time data items,
an indication that the rows are to be sorted secondly on the
time data items is also given. This second level sorting (a
sort within a sort) is indicated by a 2 placed in the sort
field adjacent to the field following the field containing
the index of the time data items. Refering to the same
individual TABLE record once again, it may be seen that
field 2 contains the index of the time data items, and a 2
is placed in the following field. The resulting table is
given in Fig. 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the rows of any
individual table may be sorted first on the data items
appearing in a specified column by placing a 1 in the sort
field following the field containing the index of these data
items. The rows of the table may be sorted second on the
data items appearing in another specified column by placing
a 2 in the sort field following the field containing the
index of these data items. A third level sort may be defined
similarly, and so on, up to an 8-level sort. There can be no
sort on the NONMEM generated data items. These data items
are not ones the user selects for tabulation, and only data
items of selected types may be sorted. Although the DV data
items always appear in a table, the user may explicitly
select these for tabulation and thereby also sort on them.
If this is done, the DV data items will appear in two
columns. They will appear in the fourth column from the
right as usual, and they will also appear in some other
column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The column order of the data
item types selected to appear in the table corresponds to
their sort codes. The data item type with sort code 1
corresponds to column 1, the data item type with sort code 2
corresponds to column 2, etc. For example, in the table of
Fig. 40, the P/S data items appear in column 1, and the time
data items appear in column 2. Any data item types with sort
code blank or 0 correspond to columns occuring after those
columns with sorted data items, and the column order of
these data item types corresponds to the order in which
their indices are placed in the TABLE record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As explained in section C.3.5.3,
when there are more than 900 data records, each individual
TABLE record generates a number of tables, so that all data
records are used. All sorting is done within each of these
tables separately. This implies that if, for example, (i)
sorting is specified only on ID data items, (ii) these data
items are all positive integers, and (iii) the data records
with ID data item equal to 1 are data records 900 and 901,
then the first of these two records is used to obtain the
first row in the first table, and the second record is used
to obtain the first row in the second table.</p>

<h2>D.5.5. Separating Scatterplots
<a name="5.5."></a>
<a name="5.5. Separating Scatterplots"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A family of scatterplots may be
defined by separating a given scatterplot, called the
<b>base plot,</b> into a number of separate ones. To do
this, a third data item type, called the <b>separator,</b>
is specified, in addition to the two types of data items
defining the given scatterplot. Suppose the values for the
separator that appear in the data set are:
<img src="grohtml-19414-104.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-104.png">
,
<img src="grohtml-19414-105.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-105.png">
, ..., sorted from lowest to highest value. Then one
scatterplot of the family consists of those points of the
base plot resulting from all data records with the value
<img src="grohtml-19414-106.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-106.png">
of the separator; another consists of those points of the
base plot resulting from all data records with value
<img src="grohtml-19414-107.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-107.png">
of the separator; etc. The family members appear in the
printout in the same order as the sorted values of the
separator. The family is called a <b>one-way partitioned
scatterplot.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is useful in the
example where it is desirable, for example, to separately
plot the plasma concentrations vs their predictions, and the
saliva concentrations versus their predictions. By choosing
the P/S data item type for the separator, the base plot of
the DV data items vs the prediction data items can be
separated into the two desired plots. The P/S data item type
has two values, 0 and 1. The points of the base plot
resulting from all data records with P/S data item equal to
0 form one of the desired plots, while the remaining points
of the base plot, resulting from all data records with P/S
data item equal to 1, form the other plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this feature two
additional fields of the individual SCATTERPLOT record
defining the family are used. As usual, the indices of the
data items defining the base plot are placed in fields 1 and
2. A 1 is placed in field 3; this indicates that one
separator is used. Also, the index of the separator is
placed in field 4. See, for example, the last SCATTERPLOT
record of Fig. 39.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Altogether, eight families of
scatterplots are defined in the problem specification of
Fig. 39. Four single-member families, CONC vs TIME, PRED vs
TIME, RES vs TIME, and PRED vs CONC, using the labels that
appear on the scatterplots, are defined. Four two-member
families are also defined, using the same base plots and
using the P/S data item type as a separator. The entire set
of thirteen scatterplots is given in Figs. 41-52.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some general remarks concerning
scatterplots involving residual and weighted residual data
items are in order. These scatterplots are often used to
detect model weaknesses. Residuals, in particular, can be
scatterplotted against the values of an independent variable
(a fixed effect). Ideally, the plot should have the
appearance of a homogeneous scatter about the zero line. If
it does not, this can suggest that the effect of the
variable is not appropriately modeled, and the pattern of
the scatter may suggest a more appropriate model. If there
is another independent variable which can affect the data,
then it can be helpful to develop a picture wherein the
effects of the two variables are not confounded. Using the
second variable as a separator can help in this regard. This
presumes that the second variable is also a fixed effect,
and that its values exist as data items in the data set. A
random effect is a type of independent variable, and it also
can be somewhat confounded with the effect of the first
variable. The values of the random effect, however, are not
known. When, though, there are several observations from
some individuals, then the ID data item can be used as a
separator to help distinguish random interindividual effects
from the effect of the first variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the desire for homogeneous
residuals is predicated on the assumption that under the
assumed model, and ignoring estimation error, the residuals
are uncorrelated and have means 0 and constant variance
(i.e. homogeneous variance). In each of the two examples
used in this chapter, however, under the model, the
variances of the observations (and therefore, of the
residuals) vary with values of fixed effect independent
variables. Weighted residuals, on the other hand, are
uncorrelated and have means 0 and constant variance under
the assumed model (and ignoring estimation error). So it is
generally advisable that with models under which residuals
are nonhomogeneous, weighted residuals, rather than
residuals, should be plotted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first example, weighted
residual vs time was plotted, but in fact, the plot does not
appear too different from a plot of residual vs time (not
shown; but see the plot of residual vs time in Fig. 18). In
the second example (the one under discussion) there really
is not a need to plot weighted residuals because <b>when</b>
the P/S data item type is used as a separator, the modeled
variances of the observations are constant with time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A base plot can be separated
into a family based on the values of two separators. Such a
family is called a <b>two-way partitioned scatterplot.</b>
Consider all distinct pairs of values, one value from the
first separator and the other value from the second
separator. Then one scatterplot of the family consists of
those points of the base plot resulting from the data
records with one particular pair of values of the
separators, and another scatterplot of the family consists
of those points of the base plot resulting from the data
records with another pair of values of the separators, etc.
To obtain a two-way partitioned scatterplot, place a 2 in
field 3 of the individual SCATTERPLOT record, and place the
indices of the two separators in fields 4 and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The summary of the problem
specification shown in Fig. 39 is given in Fig. 53. Some
remarks concerning it may be helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total number of individuals
is stated to be 17. Due to the presence of ID data items,
individual records are defined, and the number of such
records may be verified to be 17.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The matrix
<img src="grohtml-19414-108.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-108.png">
is stated to have a certain block form. Its lower triangular
part is shown schematically to indicate that it is a simple
<img src="grohtml-19414-109.png" alt="Image grohtml-19414-109.png">
matrix. The matrix could be constrained to have a block
diagonal form, in which case this form would be indicated
with a more &quot;interesting&quot; schematic pattern than
that shown in this problem summary (see NONMEM Users Guide,
Part II).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final parameter estimate,
standard errors, and correlation matrix are shown in Figs.
