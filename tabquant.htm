 MEANING: TABLE_QUANT program
 CONTEXT: NONMEM run

 The  utility  program table_quant transforms importance sampling (SIR)
 data in the NONMEM raw output file.  Such data are  present  when  the
 option SIRSAMPLE of the $COVARIANCE record is used.
 (See  Guide  Introduction_7,  "Importance  Sampling  of  the Variance-
 Covariance of  the  Parameter  Estimates").
 Table_quant produces a table file with frequencies and cumulative val-
 ues.

 USAGE:
 table_quant inputfile outputfile delimiter start end

 Inputfile name should be the NONMEM file (root.ext).
 Requred

 The  results  are written to outputfile, which may be called root.qnt.
 (This name is needed if R script quantplot.R, or Splus script,  quant-
 plot.ssc, available in Pdx-Pop 5.2, is used to view histograms and cdf
 plots from these result files.)  The output file  contains,  for  each
 item,  the  sorted value, its frequency (freq), and its quantile posi-
 tion or cumulative probability (cum).

 Required.

 Delimiter is that used in the input file (s  for  space,  t  for  tab,
 comma default)

 start  and end are the range of iterations to be quantized (default is
 all non-negative iterations).

 Table_quant uses the WEIGHT values  record  by  NONMEM  in  the  file.
 Bayes  results,  which do not have the WEIGHT column, can be processed
 with this utility, but the weight is then assumed constant  among  all
 samples.

 The output file will contain for each item, the sorted value, its fre-
 quency (freq), and its quantile  position  or  cumulative  probability
 (cum).   Also,  make  sure  the  input file contains just one table of
 information.

 See also table_resample (tabresamp) program.
