 MEANING: NONMEM's estimate of the precision of its parameter estimates
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:
 From  asymptotic statistical theory, the distribution of the parameter
 estimates is multivariate normal, with  a  variance-covariance  matrix
 that can be estimated from the data.  Such an estimate forms the basic
 output of NONMEM's Covariance Step.  The variance-covariance matrix is
 not  to  be  confused with either SIGMA, the covariance matrix for the
 second level random effects, or with OMEGA, the covariance matrix  for
 the first level random effects.  These two matrices describe the vari-
 ability of epsilons or etas, respectively,  about  their  means.   The
 variance-covariance  matrix  of  the (distribution of) parameter esti-
 mates, on the other hand, describes the variability under the  assumed
 model  of  the  parameter  estimates across (imagined) replicated data
 sets, using the design of the real data  set.   The  following  is  an
 example  of  the  NONMEM  output  giving the estimate of the variance-
 covariance matrix.

 **************** COVARIANCE MATRIX OF ESTIMATE  ********************

 The matrix (which is symmetric) is given in lower triangular form.  In
 this  example,  the 2x2 matrix, OMEGA, was constrained to be diagonal;
 the omitted entries above (.........) indicate that OM12 is not  esti-
 mated,  and  consequently has no corresponding row/column in the vari-
 ance-covariance matrix.  When the size of the array exceeds  75x75,  a
 compressed  form  is  printed in which the omitted entries (.........)
 are not printed.  The compressed form may also be requested for arrays
 smaller than 75x75 (See <A HREF="$.htm#$covariance">$covariance</A>).

 The  (estimated) variance-covariance matrix is computed from the R and
 S matrices; it is Rinv*S*Rinv, where Rinv is  the  inverse  of  the  R
 matrix.  The R matrix is the Hessian matrix of the objective function,
 evaluated at the parameter estimates.  The S  matrix  is  obtained  by
 summing  the  cross-product  gradient  vectors of the individual-based
 objective functions, evaluated at the parameter estimates.   The indi-
 vidual-based objective functions are the separate terms contributed by
 each individual's data to the  overall  objective  function,  and  the
 cross-product  gradient  vectors  are summed across the individuals in
 the data set.

 The  inverse  variance-covariance  matrix  R*Sinv*R  is  also   output
 (labeled  as the Inverse Covariance Matrix), where Sinv is the inverse
 of the S matrix.  If S is judged to be singular, a pseudo-inverse of S
 is  used,  and since a pseudo-inverse is not unique, the inverse vari-
 ance-covariance matrix is really not  unique.   In  either  case,  the
 inverse variance-covariance matrix can be used to develop a joint con-
 fidence region for the complete set of population parameters.   As  we
 usually  develop a confidence region for a very limited set of popula-
 tion parameters, this use of the inverse variance-covariance matrix is
 somewhat limited.

 An error message from the Covariance Step stating that the R matrix is
 not positive semidefinite suggests that the  parameter  estimate  does
 not  correspond  to  a  true (local) minimum and is not to be trusted.
 (It may be a saddle point.)  An  error  message  stating  that  the  R
 matrix  is  positive  semidefinite,  but  singular, indicates that the
 objective function is flat in a neighborhood of  the  parameter  esti-
 mate,  and  so the minimum is not really unique, and there is probably
 some overparametrization.  With both error messages, neither  a  vari-
 ance-covariance  matrix nor inverse variance-covariance matrix is out-
 put.  An error message stating that the S matrix is singular indicates
 strong overparameterization.  However, provided the R matrix is judged
 to be positive semidefnite and nonsingular (i.e.  positive  definite),
 both  the variance-covariance and inverse variance-covariance matrices
 are output.

 When the R matrix is judged to be singular, but positive semidefinite,
 then  the  T matrix, R*Sinv*R, where Sinv is the inverse (or a pseudo-
 inverse) of the S matrix,  is  output.   This  cannot  be  called  the
 inverse  covariance  matrix,  as the covariance matrix does not exist.
 However, as with the inverse variance-covariance matrix, T can be used
 to  develop  a joint confidence region for the complete set of popula-
 tion parameters.

 There are options that allow the variance-covariance matrix to be com-
 puted  as either 2*Rinv or 4*Sinv.  Asymptotic statistical theory sug-
 gests that these matrices are appropriate under the additional assump-
 tion  that the objective function is indeed additively proportional to
 minus twice the log likelihood function for the data.

 Unless the reported number of significant digits in the final  parame-
 ter  estimate is at least as large as the requested number of signifi-
 cant  digits,  the  Covariance   Step   will   not   be   implemented.
 (See <A HREF="s.htm#sig_digits">sig digits</A>).   Sometimes, the number of significant digits is not
 reportable.  However, when it is and the user thinks this number to be
 adequate,  and a model specification file was output (See model speci-
 fication file), NONMEM may be run again where the Covariance  Step  is
 implemented,  while  the  Estimation step is is not repeated (i.e. the
 MAXEVAL option is set to 0).  With the subsequent run, the model spec-
 ification  file  should be input, and the requested number of signifi-
 cant digits should be set to a value less than the reported number  of
 significant digits from the first run (presumably, this value would be
 the reported number rounded down to the highest integral value).
