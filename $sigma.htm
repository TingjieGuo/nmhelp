 MEANING: Supplies initial estimates for the NONMEM SIGMA Matrix
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN Control Record

 USAGE:
 $SIGMA  [DIAGONAL(n)|BLOCK(n)|BLOCK(n) SAME(m)|BLOCK SAME(m)]
         [BLOCK(n)VALUES(diag,odiag)]
         [VARIANCE|STANDARD]  [COVARIANCE|CORRELATON] [CHOLESKY]
         [[value1]  [value2]  [value3] ... [FIXED]]
         [(value)xn]

 SAMPLE:
 $SIGMA BLOCK(3)  6. .005 .3 .0002 .006 .4

 DISCUSSION:
 Gives initial estimates and constraints for elements of one or several
 blocks of the SIGMA matrix, i.e., the matrix of variances and  covari-
 ances  of the epsilon variables in the statistical model.  This record
 should appear only if the statistical  model  contains  epsilon  vari-
 ables,  i.e., the data are population.  Multiple $SIGMA records may be
 used to define multiple blocks of SIGMA.  The order of the  appearance
 of  all blocks over all records corresponds to the order of the blocks
 in SIGMA.

 OPTIONS:

 There are four forms:

 1.   $SIGMA   [DIAGONAL(n)] [ v11 v22 v33 ... vnn ]

      This gives the initial estimates of the diagonal  elements  of  a
      diagonal block of SIGMA.  E.g.,
        $SIGMA .04 .12
        Initial estimate of variance of eps(1) = .04
        Initial estimate of variance of eps(2) = .12
      Each  initial  estimate  may  optionally be coded with one of the
      forms:
         init options      (init options)        (options init)

      Any initial value or group of initial values may be  enclosed  in |
      parentheses  and  followed  by "xn", which means to replicate the |
      values within parentheses n times ("repeated value").             |
      Options apply only to a single initial estimate (i.e.,  a  single |
      1x1  block)  and  must  follow the initial estimate unless within |
      parentheses.

      Option FIXED indicates that the variance is to be constrained  to
      be fixed to the given initial estimate.  (When FIXED appears any-
      where, then the block is described by  NONMEM  as  consisting  of
      separate blocks, each of dimension one.)

      Option VARIANCE indicates that the initial estimate is understood
      to be a variance of the epsilons.  This is the default.

      Option STANDARD indicates that the initial estimate is understood
      to  be  a  standard deviation of the epsilons.  May also be coded
      SD.

      An initial estimate may be 0 only if  the  variance  or  standard
      deviation is fixed to this estimate.

 2.   $SIGMA BLOCK(n) [ v11 v21 v22 v31 v32 v33 ... vn1 vn2 ... vnn ]

      This  gives the initial estimates of all the elements of a nondi-
      agonal ("full") block of SIGMA.  E.g.,
        $SIGMA BLOCK(2) .04 .002 .12
        Initial estimate of variance of eps(1) = .04
        Initial estimate of covariance of eps(2), eps(1) = .002
        Initial estimate of variance of eps(2) = .12

      Any initial value or group of initial values may be  enclosed  in |
      parentheses  and  followed  by "xn", which means to replicate the |
      values within parentheses n times ("repeated value").

      The following options apply to the entire block  and  may  appear
      anywhere among the list of initial estimates:

      FIXED  indicates that the entire block is constrained to be fixed
      to its initial estimate.

      VARIANCE indicates that all initial estimates given for  diagonal
      elements  are  understood to be initial estimates of variances of
      epsilons.  This is the default.

      STANDARD indicates that all initial estimates given for  diagonal
      elements are understood to be initial estimates of standard devi-
      ations of epsilons.  May also be coded SD.

      COVARIANCE indicates that all initial  estmates  given  for  off-
      diagonal  elements  are  understood  to  be  initial estimates of
      covariances of epsilons.  This is the default.

      CORRELATON indicates that all initial  estmates  given  for  off-
      diagonal  elements are understood to be initial estimates of cor-
      relations of epsilons.

      CHOLESKY indicates that the block is specified  in  its  Cholesky
      form.

      Options  VARIANCE  or STANDARD may be combined with COVARIANCE or
      CORRELATON.

      Note that NONMEM converts all initial estimates to  variance  and
      covariances.   The  values  desplayed in the NONMEM report and in
      the raw and additional output  files  are  always  variances  and
      covariances.

      The (entire) initial estimate of the block must be positive defi-
      nite.  The only exception is when the entire initial estimate  of
      the  block is 0, in which case it must be fixed to this estimate.
      Initial estimates of some of the elements of the block may be  0,
      while  initial  estimates  of some other elements may be nonzero,
      but only in the case where the block is constrained to be of band
      symmetric  form.  That is, given the diagonal and a group of con-
      tiguous subdiagonals symmetrically ocurring across the  diagonal,
      the  elements off both the diagonal and the subdiagonals are con-
      strained to be zero.  To specify the initial estimates of such  a
      block,  the  initial  estimates  of those elements that are to be
      constrained to 0 should be given as 0, while  all  other  initial
      estimates  should  be  given as nonzero.  E.g., with these struc-
      tures for $SIGMA BLOCK(3), the 0's are preserved:
       x
       0x
       00x

       x
       xx
       0xx

      With NONMEM 7.3, if the initial estimate of a block is not  posi- |
      tive  definite  because of rounding errors, a value will be added |
      to the diagonal elements to make it positive definite. A  message |
      in  the  NONMEM  report  file  will  indicate that this was done. |
      E.g.,                                                             |
      DIAGONAL SHIFT OF  1.1000E-03 WAS IMPOSED TO ENSURE POSITIVE DEF- |
      INITENESS

 3.   $SIGMA BLOCK(n) SAME(m)

      This  describes a block whose initial estimates, as well as final
      estimates, are constrained to be equal to those of the  preceding
      block. Values may not be given. "(n)" may be omitted.
      "(m) may be omitted. If m is present, then this record is equiva- |
      lent to m identical records without (m).  E.g.,                   |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(2) SAME(3)                                           |
      is equivalent to                                                  |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(2) SAME                                              |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(2) SAME                                              |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(2) SAME                                              |

 4.                                                                     |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(n) VALUES(diag,odiag)                                |

      This supplies initial values for a block such  that  the  initial |
      estimates of the diagonal elements are all the same, specified by |
      "diag", and the initial estimates of  the  off-diagonal  elements |
      are  all  the  same,  specified  by  "odiag".  VALUES must follow |
      BLOCK.  Other options (such as  FIXED,  CHOLESKY,  VARIANCE,STAN- |
      DARD,COVARIANCE,CORRELATON)   may  follow  VALUES  or  be  placed |
      between BLOCK and VALUES.                                         |
      E.g.,                                                             |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(6) VALUES(0.1,0.01)                                  |
      is the same as                                                    |
      $SIGMA BLOCK(6)                                                   |
      0.1                                                               |
      0.01 0.1                                                          |
      (0.01)x2 0.1                                                      |
      (0.01)x3 0.1                                                      |
      (0.01)x4 0.1                                                      |
      (0.01)x5 0.1                                                      |

 If the values are omitted in forms 1 or 2, then  NONMEM  will  try  to
 obtain initial estimates.
