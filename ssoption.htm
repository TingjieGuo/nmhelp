 MEANING: Choice of Steady-State Routine for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: Option of NM-TRAN $SUBROUTINES record

 USAGE:
 $SUBROUTINES ... [SS=]name

 SAMPLE:
 $SUBROUTINE ADVAN=ADVAN6 SS=SS6

 DISCUSSION:
 The  SS  option  tells NM-TRAN that a SS routine should be included in
 the NONMEM/PREDPP executable.  It is optional.

 PREDPP contains a library of routines, including SS routines  to  com-
 pute  steady-state  kinetics.  The SS routines all have the same entry
 name, SS.  Most analytic ADVAN routines have a corresponding  specific
 SS routine except for ADVAN8 and ADVAN10, for which SS6 is used.

 If  the  SS data item is present in the $INPUT record, then an SS rou-
 tine is required in the NONMEM/PREDPP executable.  NM-TRAN will supply
 the  SS  option  of the $SUBROUTINES record if it is not present.  The
 default pairing of ADVAN and SS routines is:

 ADVAN1-SS1 ; ADVAN2-SS2 ; ADVAN3-SS3 ; ADVAN4-SS4
 ADVAN5-SS5 ; ADVAN6-SS6 ; ADVAN7-SS7 ; ADVAN8-SS6
 ADVAN9-SS9 ; ADVAN10-SS6 ADVAN11-SS11 ; ADVAN12-SS12
 ADVAN13-SS6; ADVAN14-SS6; ADVAN15-SS9; ADVAN16-SS6
 ADVAN17-SS9; ADVAN18-SS6

 (With versions prior to NONMEM 7.4, SS13 was used with  ADVAN13.   See
 ADVAN13 help entry for other changes to ADVAN13.)

 The  SS option can be used to request creation of a NONMEM/PREDPP exe-
 cutable which contains an SS routine even though the current data  set
 does not contain the SS data item.

 The  only  real  effect  of  the  SS option is to list the name of the
 desired SS routine in NM-TRAN's FREPORT file.  The actual construction
 of the executable is the users responsibility.

 When the SS option is not included on the $SUBROUTINES record, and the
 SS data item does not appear on the $DATA record, then  NM-TRAN  lists
 the  null  SSS  routine (SSS0) in FREPORT and no SS routine is listed.
 Otherwise, NM-TRAN lists the (non-null) SSS  routine  ("Supervisor  of
 Steady-State") and the appropriate SS routine.

 The  nmfe  and  nmfe.bat commands automatically include the listed SSS
 and SS routines in the NONMEM executable.
