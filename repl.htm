 MEANING: Replication (REPL_) data item
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 USAGE:
 $INPUT ... REPL_ ...

 DISCUSSION:
 REPL_  labels NONMEM's replication (REPL_) data item.  The replication
 data item is optional.  When the REPL_ data item is listed in  $INPUT,
 the  NONMEM  data set is considered to be a template data set.  NONMEM
 itself replicates subjects from the template data set at the start  of
 the problem to create an expanded NONMEM data set.

 (Note  that  the NONMEM data set is typically the file FDATA generated
 by NM-TRAN, unless there is nothing for NM-TRAN to change and the for-
 mat  is  supplied on the $DATA record, in which case the file named on
 the $DATA record is the NONMEM data set.  See NONMEM Users Guide, Part
 IV.)

 The  value of REPL_ is the replication number for that subject. If the
 value is fractional, it will be  truncated  to  the  nearest  integer.
 Only  the  REPL_  value of the first record of each individual will be
 used to determine its replication number.  If  for  some  subject  the
 value of  REPL_ is 0, the subject is deleted from the NONMEM data set.

 REPL_ may be used with the $DATA ... REPL option, which replicates the
 entire data set REPL=n times.  If both are used the  REPL_  data  item
 applies first, and the REPL option applies second.
 See REPL option of $DATA record.
 The REPL option and REPL_ data item are meant to be used with $SIMULA-
 TION or $DESIGN.
