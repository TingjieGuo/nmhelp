 MEANING: CCONTR subroutine
 CONTEXT: User-supplied subroutine; replaces a NONMEM dummy routine

 This feature is not fully documented.  The interested user may be able
 to obtain more information by studying  the  appropriate  sections  of
 NONMEM  code and previous examples that may be available from advanced
 users.

 USAGE:
      SUBROUTINE CCONTR (I,CNT,P1,P2,IER1,IER2)
      USE SIZES, ONLY: ISIZE,DPSIZE
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE), INTENT(IN OUT)    :: I,IER1,IER2
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE),   INTENT(IN OUT)    :: CNT,P1(:),P2(:,:)

 DISCUSSION:
 CCONTR is a user-supplied routine for computing the contribution  made
 to  the  objective function from an L2 record.  It is used to override
 the NONMEM default objective function.

 CCONTR may be used when there are no epsilons or  etas  and  in  other
 situations, e.g., with categorical population data.

 NONMEM sometimes produces this error message:
 USER CCONTR ROUTINE NOT USED, BUT THERE ARE NO EPSILONS,
 AND ETAS ARE TO BE ESTIMATED

 This can happen when POSTHOC etas are requested, but the data are sin-
 gle-subject data.  The user may have included the  POSTHOC  option  in
 error.

 The CCONTR routine may contain the following code:
 CALL CELS (CNT,P1,P2,IER1,IER2)

 If  the  data  is  correlated across L2 records (e.g., auto-regressive
 data), CCONTR computes the contribution to the objective function  for
 data from an entire individual record.

 Input argument:

  I   Similar to Ifor PRED subroutine
      Possible values: 0, 1, 2

 Output argument:

  CNT The  conditional  contribution to the objective function for this
      L2 record.

  P1  P1(i) is the partial derivative of CNT with respect to eta(i).

  P2  P2(i,j) is the second partial derivative of CNT with  respect  to
      eta(i) and eta(j) (for i &lt;= j).
      At  ICALL=1,  CCONTR  sets P2(1,1)=-1 if second derivative values
      are to be used.  Otherwise, if cross-gradient values  are  to  be
      used.

  IER1
      0 - Normal return.
      non-zero - error return.

  IER2
      0 if error-recovery is to be implemented when IER1 is nonzero.
      1 if NONMEM is to stop when IER1 is nonzero.

 Other inputs
      Other  inputs  are available to CCONTR in NONMEM read-only global
      variables.
      (See <A HREF="m.htm#mix_contr:_theta">MIX_CONTR:_THETA</A>)
      E.g., USE ROCM_REAL,   ONLY: THETA=&gt;THETAC
      (See <A HREF="c.htm#ccontr:_y">CCONTR:_Y</A>,DATA,N1,N2,DIM)
      (See <A HREF="c.htm#ccontr:_f">CCONTR:_F</A>,G,H)

 CCONTR is called by NONMEM's NCONTR routine with one  level  2  ("L2")
 record  after  another.  If no CCONTR routine is supplied by the user,
 NCONTR calls NONMEM utility CELS ("Conditional ELS"; ELS  contribution
 conditional  on  knowing  eta).   If  no L2 data item is present, each
 level 2 record is a single observation event record.  Otherwise, it is
 a  group  of observation records grouped together by a common value of
 L2.
