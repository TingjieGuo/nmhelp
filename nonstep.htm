 MEANING: Sequence of events in a NONMEM problem
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:

 NONMEM  loads information from a model specification file, if $MSFI is
 present NONMEM makes a single call to  PRED  (with  ICALL=0),  at  the
 beginning  of  the  run, to allow PRED to undertake run initialization
 (INITL).

 NONMEM makes a single call to PRED (with ICALL=1), at the beginning of
 every  problem,  to  allow  PRED  to  undertake problem initialization
 (INITL).

 SIMULATION STEP
      NONMEM inputs initial fixed effects parameters from  file  speci-
      fied  by  $CHAIN, if record is present NONMEM performs simulation
      (with ICALL=4) (if $SIMULATION present).

 INITIAL ESTIMATE STEP (with ICALL=2)
      NONMEM obtains initial estimates for theta, omega, sigma (if  the
      control stream does not provide all initial estimates).

 ESTIMATION STEP (with ICALL=2)
      NONMEM inputs initial etas from file specified by $ETAS/$PHIS, if
      record is present NONMEM searches for parameter values that mini-
      mize the objective function (if $ESTIMATION present).  With  NON- |
      MEM 7, multiple Estimation Steps can be implemented in  a  single |
      problem.   A  sequence  of  two  or  more  Estimation Steps  will |
      result in the sequential execution of each.

 COVARIANCE STEP (with ICALL=2)
      NONMEM obtains a variance-covariance matrix of the estimator  and
      related  information  such  as  standard  errors  (if $COVARIANCE
      present).

 FINALIZATION STEP (with ICALL=2,5,6)
      NONMEM obtains the following as needed:
           Classification into subpopulations (if a  MIXTURE  model  is |
           used)(FNLMOD).
           Posthoc estimates of eta (FNLETA).                           |
           Nonparametric  step  (NONPAR,  with ICALL=2): NONMEM obtains
           either marginal cumulatives or  conditional  (nonparametric)
           estimates of etas (if $NONPARAMETRIC present).
           PRED-defined values from NMPRD4 (NP4F) (for tables and scat-
           terplots).

 NONMEM computes WRES and other diagnostics if they are to be displayed |
 in tables or scatters. (PRRES)

 NONMEM makes a single call to PRED (with ICALL=3), at the end of every
 problem (and subproblem), to allow PRED to undertake problem finaliza-
 tion.

 TABLE STEP
      NONMEM constructs tables (if $TABLE present).

 SCATTERPLOT STEP
      NONMEM constructs scatterplots (if $SCATTERPLOT present).
