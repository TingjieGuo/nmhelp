 MEANING: The data to be analyzed by NONMEM
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:
 "Data  set"  refers  to  all of the data (from all of the individuals)
 that is to be used in the NONMEM analysis.  NONMEM is aware of certain
 features  of  the data.  NONMEM lists what it knows about the data set
 as a check for the user.

 DATA SET LOCATED ON UNIT NO.:    2
 THIS UNIT TO BE REWOUND:        NO
 NO. OF DATA RECS IN DATA SET:  394
 NO. OF DATA ITEMS IN DATA SET:   8
 ID DATA ITEM IS DATA ITEM NO.:   1
 DEP VARIABLE IS DATA ITEM NO.:   4

 The above states that the data set is associated with a file  on  FOR-
 TRAN logical unit 2.  The rewind feature ("UNIT TO BE REWOUND ...") is
 of interest only if this is not the first problem of the  NONMEM  run.
 The  other lines report how many records were read, the number of data
 items on each record, and the index  order  of  the  two  NONMEM  data
 items, ID (identification) and DV (dependent variable).

 (See <A HREF="d.htm#data_record">data record</A>, <A HREF="d.htm#data_item">data item</A>).
