 MEANING: Choice of Pharmacokinetic Model for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: Option of NM-TRAN $SUBROUTINES record

 USAGE:
 $SUBROUTINES [ADVAN=]ADVAN2

 SAMPLE:
 $SUBROUTINE ADVAN2

 DISCUSSION:
 ADVAN2  is  a routine in PREDPP's library which implements the kinetic
 equations for the  One  Compartment  Linear  Model  with  First  Order
 Absorption.

 Compt.   Function   Initial   On/Off    Dose      Default    Default
 No.                 Status    Allowed   Allowed   for Dose   for Obs.
 1        Depot      Off       Yes       Yes       Yes        No
 2        Central    On        No        Yes       No         Yes
 3        Output     Off       Yes       No        No         No

 TRANS routines that may be used: TRANS1, TRANS2

 Basic PK parameters with TRANS1:

      K  (rate constant of elimination)
      KA (rate constant of absorption)

 Basic PK parameters with TRANS2: (See <A HREF="t.htm#trans2">TRANS2</A>).

 Additional PK parameters:

      S1 - Scale for depot compartment
      S2 - Scale for central compartment (also called SC)
      S3 - Scale for output compartment (also called S0)
      F1 - Bioavailability for depot compartment
      F2 - Bioavailability for central compartment
      R1 - Rate for depot compartment
      R2 - Rate for central compartment
      D1 - Duration for depot compartment
      D2 - Duration for central compartment
      ALAG1 - Absorption lag for depot compartment
      ALAG2 - Absorption lag for central compartment
      F0 - Output fraction (also called F3, FO)
      XSCALE - Time scale
      MTIME(i) - Model event times
