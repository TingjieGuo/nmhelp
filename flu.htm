 MEANING: FLU subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM user-installation routine

 USAGE:
       SUBROUTINE FLU (I)
       RETURN
       END

 DISCUSSION:

 Routine  FLU  is  a  user-installation routine.  It allows the user to
 cause NONMEM to execute statements needed with certain operating  sys-
 tems.

 FLU  is called by NONMEM whenever the buffer for an I/O unit should be
 emptied.  Buffer emptying is controlled in an  operating  system  spe-
 cific  way,  and often a compiler that is supported under an operating
 system will support a FORTRAN language extension that allows a  buffer
 to  be  emptied.  Whenever possible, such a FORTRAN instruction should
 be coded into FLU.  FLU has one argument, I, which is the I/O  logical
 unit  number.   The  statement that should be inserted prior to RETURN
 follows, for two different operating systems, is as follows:

 (Sun UNIX):
       CALL FLUSH (I)

 (MS WINDOWS 95):
       CALL COMMITQQ (I)
