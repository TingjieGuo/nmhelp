 MEANING: NONMEM Raw Output file
 CONTEXT: NONMEM Output Files

 DISCUSSION:

 With  NONMEM 7, a NONMEM run produces several additional output files.
 These provide a more efficient way  of  way  of  extracting  numerical
 results  from  the  analysis  than  by  obtaining them from the NONMEM
 report file.
 (See <A HREF="a.htm#additional_output_file">additional_output_file</A>).

 Names of the files start with "root", where root is the root name (not
 including  extension)  of the NM-TRAN control stream file given at the
 nmfe7 command line, or root="nmbayes" if the control stream file  name
 is  not passed as an argument to the NONMEM executable.  E.g., in this
 example the root is myexample.
 nmfe7 myexample.ctl myexample.res
 The raw output file ("root.ext") will be named myexample.ext

 A different name for this file may be specified using  the  FILE=file-
 name  option of the $ESTIMATION record.  This filename is used for all
 subsequent problems, until a new FILE=filename option is  coded.   The
 raw output file is only generated if the $ESTIMATION record is present
 and accumulates information from each Estimation step.

 The first two lines of each file is the same.  First is a header  line
 that begins with the word TABLE, such as:

 TABLE NO.     n:

 These  tables  are  not  related  to  the  ones produced by the $TABLE
 record.  The value of n is incremented each time the  Estimation  Step
 is  implemented,  i.e.,  once per $ESTIM record, when MAXEVAL is not 0
 and $EST is not omitted.  The $EST records may be in the same problem,
 or  in  subsequent  problems.  If $COV is present in a problem without
 $EST (e.g., when $MSFI is used), then n is also incremented.

 Next on the header line is the analysis text (same  as  given  on  the
 #METH: line in the report file), e.g., "First Order".

 In  the  raw  output  file,  the analysis text is followed by the goal
 function text (same as given on the #OBJT: line in the  report  file),
 e.g.,
 Goal Function=MINIMUM VALUE OF OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
 At the end of the header line is:
 Problem=1 Subproblem=0 Superproblem1=0 Iteration1=0
           Superproblem2=0 Iteration2=0

 The  values  of Problem, Subproblem, Superproblem1, Iteration1, Super-
 problem2, Iteration2 are the same values as would be found in the fol-
 lowing variables in modules during the run:
 IPROB IREP S1NUM S1IT  S2NUM S2IT
 (See <A HREF="p.htm#problem_iteration_counters">Problem_Iteration_Counters</A>).

 The second line of the raw output file contains the column headers for
 the table, all on one line.

 Options NOTITLE and NOLABEL and FORMAT of the $ESTIMATION  record  can
 be  used  to  supress the first and/or second lines, and to modify the
 format of the values in the table.  They apply to raw  and  additional
 output  files,  but only for the current Estimation Step.  The options
 must be re-specified with each $EST record.

 Values of the Parameters and of the  objective function are printed to
 the raw output file every PRINT iterations.  The default order is:
 ITERATION  THETA,  SIGMA,  OMEGA, OBJ (Objective function).  Values of
 Sigma and Omega  are in the original parameterization, as in the  file
 INTER.   The  option  ORDER  of  the $ESTIMATION record may be used to
 change the order of THETA, SIGMA, and OMEGA.
 (See <A HREF="o.htm#order_option">order_option</A>).

 The iteration number, which is the first value in every line, is typi-
 cally  positive,  but  also may be negative under the following condi-
 tions:

      1) The burn-in iterations of the MCMC Bayesian analysis are given
      negative values, starting at -NBURN, the number of burn-in itera-
      tions requested by the user.   These  are  followed  by  positive
      iterations of the stationary phase.

      2) The stochastic iterations of the SAEM analysis are given nega-
      tive values.  These are followed by positive  iterations  of  the
      accumulation phase.

      3)  Iteration  -1000000000  (negative one billion) identifies the
      line that contains the final result (thetas, omegas, and  sigmas,
      and  objective  function)  of the particular analysis.  These are
      the value in the NONMEM  output  file  that  are  labelled  FINAL
      PARAMETER ESTIMATE.  The order is theta, sigma, omega.

      4)  Iteration  -1000000001  identifies the line that contains the
      standard errors of the final population  parameters.   These  are
      the  value  in  the NONMEM output file that are labelled STANDARD
      ERROR OF ESTIMATE.  The order is theta, sigma, omega.  This  line
      is  present  if  the  Covariance  Step  is  successful,  or  with
      METHOD=BAYES.

      5) Iteration -1000000002 identifies the line  that  contains  the
      eigenvalues  of  the  correlation  matrix of the variances of the
      final parameters.

      6) Iteration -1000000003 identifies the line  that  contains  the
      condition  number  , lowest, highest, Eigenvalues of the correla-
      tion matrix of the variances of the final parameters.

      7) Iteration -1000000004 identifies the line  that  contains  the
      OMEGA and SIGMA elements in standard deviation/correlation format

      8)  Iteration  -1000000005  identifies the line that contains the
      standard errors to the OMEGA and SIGMA elements in standard devi-
      ation/correlation format

      9)  Iteration -1000000006 identifies the line that indicates 1 if
      parameter was fixed in estimation, 0 otherwise.

      10) Iteration -1000000007 lists termination status  (first  item)
      followed by termination codes.
           In nm73, termination status catalogs the error status:
           For traditional analyses, an error number is listed. If neg-
           ative, the analysis was user-interrupted
           For EM/Bayes analysis, error numbers map as follows:
           0,4: optimization was completed
           1,5: optimization not completed (ran out of iterations)
           2,6: optimization was not tested for convergence
           3,7: optimization was not tested  for  convergence  and  was
           user interrupted
           8,12:  objective  function  is  infinite  or  all individual
           objective fuctions are zero. problem ended
           16,20: All individual objective fuctions are  zero.  problem
           ended
           4,5,6,7,12,20: reduced stochastic/stationary portion was not
           completed prior to user interrupt

      11) Iteration -1000000008 lists the  partial  derivative  of  the
      likelihood  (-1/2OFV)  with  respect to each estimated parameter.
      This may be useful for using tests like the  Lagrange  multiplier
      test.

      See the description of root.xml in Guide INTRODUCTION TO NONMEM 7
      for versions 7.4 and higher.

 A file simliar to the raw output file is root.cnv.  This file contains
 convergence information for the Monte Carlo/EM methods, if CTYPE&gt;0:

      1)  Iteration  -2000000000  identifies the line that contains the
      mean of last CITER values (mean objective  function  is  that  of
      second to last CITER values)

      2)  Iteration  -2000000001  identifies the line that contains the
      standard deviation of last CITER values (for objective  function,
      STD of second to last CITER values)

      3)  Iteration  -2000000002  identifies the line that contains the
      linear regression p-value of last CITER values against  iteration
      number.  (for objective function, p-value of second to last CITER
      values)

      4) Iteration -2000000003 identifies the line  that  contains  the
      Alpha used to assess statistical significance (p-value&lt;alpha)

      Please note the following: The Sigma values are in their Cholesky
      format, as this is the form in which convergence of these  values
      are  tested.  The Alpha are those based on ones actually used for
      convergence test of that parameter, or which would have been used
      on that parameter if CTYPE were of proper type.  The alpha may be
      bonferoni corrected because of multiple comparisons, depending on
      number  of parameters that were tested or would have been tested.
      Objective function alphas are not bonferoni corrected.

      For importance sampling and  iterative  two  stage,  the  average
      objective  function listed in root.cnv could be used as an alter-
      native to the  final  objective  function  for  likelihood  ratio
      tests.
