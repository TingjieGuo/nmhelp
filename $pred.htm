 MEANING: Marks the beginning of abbreviated code for the PRED routine
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN Control Record

 USAGE:
 $PRED
 abbreviated code

 DISCUSSION:
 The $PRED record is used to model values for the DV data items.  It is
 NOT used with PREDPP (but (See <A HREF="$.htm#$error">$ERROR</A>).  General rules for abbreviated
 code  are documented elsewhere (See <A HREF="a.htm#abbreviated_code">abbreviated code</A>).  Specific rules
 for $PRED follow.

 ASSIGNMENT AND CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

 Left-hand quantities in assignment statements:

   Y (Required. The modeled value for the dependent variable under  the
   statistical model.)

   PRED-defined items.

 Right-hand quantities in assignment statement and in conditions:

   Data item labels specified on the $INPUT statement.

   THETA(n).

   ETA(n)  (Used if the data are population or single-subject data, and
   in the latter case can be coded ERR(n).)

   EPS(n) (Used if the data are population, and can be coded ERR(n).)

   PRED-defined items that appeared earlier  as  left-hand  quantities.
   This includes Y.

   NEWIND
    Same as the NEWIND argument passed by NONMEM to PREDPP.
    NEWIND=0:  First  record  of  the data set.  THETA value may differ
    from value at last call with this record.
    NEWIND=1: First record of the data set, THETA value does not differ
    from  value at last call with this record, and PRED is nonrecursive
    (see I_REC), or,
    First record of a subsequent individual record.
    NEWIND=2: Subsequent data record of an individual record.

   NEWL2
    NEWL2=1: First record of an L2 record.
    NEWL2=2: Otherwise.

   ICALL
    ICALL=0: Run initialization.
    ICALL=1: Problem initialization.
    ICALL=2: Normal call.
    ICALL=3: Problem finalization.
    ICALL=4: Simulation.
    ICALL=5: Expectation.
    ICALL=6: Data Average.
    Special rules apply to blocks of abbreviated code that are executed
    when ICALL is not 2.
    (See <A HREF="i.htm#initialization">initialization</A>, <A HREF="f.htm#finalization">finalization</A>, <A HREF="s.htm#simulation">simulation</A>).
    (See <A HREF="e.htm#expectation">expectation</A>, <A HREF="d.htm#data_average_block">data average</A>).

   Variables in Fortran modules
    Certain  variables  in  FORTRAN  modules  can  be used.  (See Vari-
    ables_in_modules)

 Forbidden Variable Names:

 DATREC INDXS G H DADT(n) A(n) E(n) P(n)

 PSEUDO ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS
   COMRES=-1
 RECORD ORDER:

 Follows $SUBROUTINES and $INPUT
