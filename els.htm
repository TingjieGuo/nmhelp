 MEANING: ELS subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 This feature is not fully documented.  The interested user may be able
 to obtain more information by studying  the  appropriate  sections  of
 NONMEM  code and previous examples that may be available from advanced
 users.

 USAGE:
      USE SIZES,      ONLY:: ISIZE,DPSIZE,NO
       ...
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE) :: IER1,IER2
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE)   :: CNT,D
      DIMENSION :: D(NO,2)
       ...
      CALL ELS (CNT,D,IER1,IER2)

 DISCUSSION:
 ELS is a NONMEM utility  routine.   It  computes  the  Extended  Least
 Squares  contribution  to  the  objective function for the data from a
 single individual ("L1") record.  It may be called by CONTR or SPTWO.

 Output argument:

  CNT Contribution to -2log likelihood for data from the L1  record  as
      computed by extended least squares.

   D(J,1)
      value  of  RES  for  Jth observation record of the L1 record when
      called by SPTWO; otherwise 0.

   D(J,2)
      value of WRES for Jth observation record of the  L1  record  when
      called by SPTWO; otherwise 0.

  IER1
      =0 - Normal return.
      &gt;1 - Abnormal return.

  IER2
      undocumented error return code.

 ELS obtains all its inputs from NONMEM read-only variables.

 Certain NONMEM error messages refer to ELS, for example:

 PROGRAM TERMINATED BY OBJ, ERROR IN ELS
  WITH INDIVIDUAL 1 (IN INDIVIDUAL RECORD ORDERING)
  VAR-COV OF DATA FROM INDIVIDUAL RECORD ESTIMATED TO BE SINGULAR

 A common situation giving rise to this message is the use of a propor-
 tional intra-individual error model while some  predicted  values  for
 actual  observations  are zero or close to zero.  (For example, if the
 first dose is an infusion and there is a "base- line"  observation  at
 the start of the infusion, the predicted level will be zero.)
