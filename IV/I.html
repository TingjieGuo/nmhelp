<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN stands for
<b>N</b>ON<b>M</b>EM <b>Tran</b>slator, a preprocessor to
NONMEM which translates user-inputs into i) a NONMEM data
set, ii) a NONMEM control stream, and iii) various
subroutines which must be included in a NONMEM load module.
It is a separate computer program which is written in
FORTRAN 90/95, and one <i>precedes</i> a NONMEM run by first
running it. This document describes NM-TRAN and how to use
it. In order to read this document the reader should be
familiar with the concepts and nomenclature associated with
the statistical models expressible in NONMEM. This
familiarity can be obtained by reading modeling discussions
in Guides I and VI. At the same time attention should also
be paid to material describing the concepts and nomenclature
associated with NONMEM data records and data items
(especially Guide I, section B.1) and PREDPP event records
and data items (especially chapters I, II, and V of Guide
VI), and to the concepts and nomenclature associated with
the various kinds of NONMEM output. However, material in
these guides describing how control records, file records,
and user-supplied subroutines are constructed may be
skipped. Beginning NONMEM users who desire to analyze
pharmacokinetic data will find it particularly helpful to
first read Guide V. That document is written especially for
the beginning user and from the point of view that the user
is going to use NM-TRAN. Much of NM-TRAN, as well as much
about NONMEM modeling, is described there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inputs for NM-TRAN include a
data set, the <b>NM-TRAN data set</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but this data set need not be
formatted quite as rigidly as a NONMEM data set. NM-TRAN
translates the NM-TRAN data set into a NONMEM data set. The
part of NM-TRAN which performs this translation is called
the <b>Data Preprocessor</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inputs for NM-TRAN also
include a control stream, the <b>NM-TRAN control
stream</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but, again, the language for
this control stream is much more user-friendly than the
fixed-field numerical-code type language used for a NONMEM
control stream. NM-TRAN translates the NM-TRAN control
stream into a NONMEM control stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NM-TRAN control stream can
(optionally) also include <b>abbreviated FORTRAN codes</b>
from which various completely FORTRAN-coded NONMEM
subroutines are generated. Thus, for example, from one such
abbreviated code a PRED subroutine can be generated which
computes the partial derivatives of the statistical model
with respect to @eta@ and @epsilon@ random variables and
stores them in the G and H arguments of the PRED routine.
The abbreviated code itself does not directly involve
partial derivatives. In effect, NM-TRAN performs symbolic
differentiation, and this ability probably represents its
most useful purpose. An abbreviated code also allows the
statistical models to be represented in a natural and
perspicuous symbolic way, wherein the @eta@ and @epsilon@
variables are explicitly expressed. Indeed, one need not
even understand the allusions that have just been made to
partial derivatives and G and H arrays; it is enough to
understand that a statistical model may be represented in a
natural way and that from this representation NM-TRAN
automatically generates information required by NONMEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As powerful a device as is
NM-TRAN abbreviated code, such code is still somewhat
limited, and certain complicated subroutines which could be
useful cannot be generated from it alone. It will probably
be adequate, though, for the purposes of any beginning
NONMEM user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be emphasized that
NONMEM can be used without NM-TRAN. NM-TRAN simply makes the
user&rsquo;s tasks easier, and we strongly recommend the use
of this preprocessor, especially for beginning NONMEM
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here follows an example of an
NM-TRAN control stream; it is meant to be used along with
the example of an NM-TRAN data set shown in Appendix II.
This NM-TRAN control stream is recorded on the NONMEM
distribution medium as CONTROL4; see Guide III. NM-TRAN will
translate the data set and control stream to a NONMEM data
set, a NONMEM control stream, and a completely coded PRED
subroutine. The effect of using these three NONMEM inputs in
a NONMEM run will be to produce essentially the same output
obtained from using the NONMEM control stream and PRED
subroutine shown in Figures 75 and 74 of Guide I. That is,
the effect will be to produce the same data analysis for the
population theophylline data as that presented and detailed
in chapter F of that guide. The data set, control stream,
and PRED routine produced by NM-TRAN are given in Appendix
III. They differ somewhat from the data set, control stream
and PRED routine of Figures 75 and 74. (In fact, the NONMEM
control stream of Fig. 75 contains the data itself, rather
than the data being in a separate file. NONMEM data can be
embedded in a NONMEM control file.) However, the NONMEM
output is the same, no matter whether NM-TRAN is used or
not. Subroutine PRED shown in Appendix III is a simplified
version of the subroutine PRED generated by NONMEM
7.3&rsquo;s NM-TRAN.&dagger; <br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; In order to
obtain subroutine PRED for Appendix III, the record
<tt><i>$ABBR NOFASTDER DERIV2=NO</i></tt>, was added to the
control stream so that code for eta first partial
derivatives is not collected and performed separately, and
code for eta second derivatives is not generated. Other
statements usually produced by NM-TRAN (such as those for
NMPRD4; see Chapter II) were deleted because they are not
needed for this example. Other code not relevant to the
Estimation Method of figure 75 was also omitted for the sake
of clarity. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much of the remainder of this
document is devoted to describing the language illustrated
in this example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An NM-TRAN control stream
includes control type information. It also can include
information indicating that a FORTRAN-coded PRED routine is
being supplied by the user, or it can include an abbreviated
code from which a PRED routine can be generated (as in the
example). However, NM-TRAN is also designed to make the use
of PREDPP easier. PREDPP is a special, but elaborate, PRED
routine that has been developed to assist with the task of
analyzing pharmacokinetic data; see Guide VI. So, the
NM-TRAN control stream can also include special control type
information which can be used only when PREDPP is used and
which facilitates the use of PREDPP, and it can also include
abbreviated codes from which routines for PREDPP, which are
otherwise user-supplied (INFN, MODEL, PK, ERROR, DES, AES),
can be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may also contain abbreviated
code from which a user-supplied from which a user-supplied
PRIOR subroutine can be generated. This is independent of
the choice of $PRED vs. PREDPP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accordingly, this document is
divided into a few major parts which separate PREDPP
considerations from general NONMEM considerations (see the
Table of Contents).</p>
