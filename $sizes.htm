 MEANING: Array sizes for NONMEM and PREDPP
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN Control Record

 USAGE:
 $SIZES  [constant=value] [constant=value] ...

 SAMPLE:
 $SIZES LIM1=30000 MAXFCN=2000000 NO=500

 DISCUSSION:
 $SIZES is optional.  If present, it must precede the first $PROBLEM or
 $SUPER record.

 Certain constants are used in NM-TRAN, NONMEM and PREDPP.  With NONMEM
 7.2  and  higher, the user may override many of the constants with the
 $SIZES record.

 See the discusion of sizes for a discussion of how these constants are
 determined, and how they are communicated to NONMEM and PREDPP.
 (See <A HREF="s.htm#sizes_fsizes_prsizes">SIZES FSIZES prsizes</A>)

 Any  non-zero  value specified on the $SIZES record overrides both the
 default and the value that NM-TRAN would have specified.  (A value  of
 0  is  ignored.)   As  of  NONMEM  7.3, as an alternative to modifying |
 sizes.f90 to very large maximum sizes, you can tell NMTRAN the maximum |
 size  that may be needed by specifying a $SIZES constant as a negative |
 value. Thus, a user can give NMTRAN permission to deal with all  prob- |
 lems  that  have data input files that have up to 1000 data items, and |
 up to 150 etas and epsilons, and up to 200 thetas, by the following:   |

 $SIZES PD=-1000 LVR=-150 LTH=-200                                      |

 but the values of these constants when the NONMEM executable  is  con- |
 structed  will  be  only what is needed for the particular problem. In |
 contrast,                                                              |

 $SIZES PD=1000 LVR=150 LTH=200                                         |

 will result in sizing the NONMEM executable  with  these  values,  and |
 won't  make  a  "tailor  fit".  This would result in a very large exe- |
 cutable regardless of the model size. Thus,                            |
 $SIZES PD=-1000                                                        |
 tells NMTRAN that you may need as many as 1000 data items  in  a  data |
 file, whereas                                                          |
 $SIZES PD=1000                                                         |
 tells NMTRAN that you need exactly that size.
