 MEANING: Choice of Pharmacokinetic Model for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: Option of NM-TRAN $SUBROUTINES record

 USAGE:
 $SUBROUTINES [ADVAN=]ADVAN6

 SAMPLE:
 $SUBROUTINE ADVAN6

 DISCUSSION:
 ADVAN6,  ADVAN8   ADVAN13,  ADVAN14,  ADVAN16, ADVAN18 are routines in
 PREDPP's library which implement the general  non-linear  model.   The
 general  non-linear  model is used for systems in which a drug is dis-
 tributed between compartments according to first-order processes.  The
 differences  are  in the package of code that performs the integration
 of the differential equations.

      ADVAN6 uses IMSL's DVERK, a Runge-Kutta-Verner  fifth  and  sixth
      order method of integration, for nonstiff problems.

      ADVAN8  uses  IMSL's DGEAR, the Gear method of numerical integra-
      tion, for stiff problems.

      ADVAN13 uses the LLNL solver for ordinary differential  equations
      (LSODA), with automatic method switching for stiff (BDF) and non-
      stiff (Adams method) problems. It is a decendent of ADVAN8.

      ADVAN14 uses CVODES from the LLNL SUNDIALS  system  for  ordinary
      differential  equations  and  is a descendent of LSODA (ADVAN13).
      ADVAN14 also has a root-finding algorithm.
      The user may choose to make  modifications  to  ..\pr\CVODEU.f90.
      See ..\guides\cvs_guide.pdf and ..\guides\cv_guide.pdf.

      ADVAN16 uses the RADAR5 delay differential equation solver.
      See  INTRODUCTION TO NONMEM 7, Using the Delay differential equa-
      tion Solvers with the ddexpand program.
      See also ..\guides\manrad5-v2.pdf.
      See also ..\examples\dde\advan16_dde.pdf

      ADVAN18 uses the DDE_SOLVER delay differential equation solver.
      See INTRODUCTION TO NONMEM 7, Using the Delay differential  equa-
      tion Solvers with the ddexpand program.
      See also ..\guides\ddes_f90.pdf.
      See also ..\examples\dde\advan16_dde.pdf

 ADVAN8 may be used in preference to ADVAN6 when the differential equa-
 tions describing the processes are stiff.  ADVAN13 may  be  preferable
 with  a  mixed  system  (both stiff and non-stiff).  For discussion of
 ADVAN14 as well as changes to ADVAN13, see Guide INTRODUCTION TO  NON-
 MEM 7.

 A  $MODEL  record  is  required to describe the compartments and their
 attributes.  The $DES record is required to describe the  differential
 equations.

 TRANS routines that may be used: TRANS1

 Explicit Basic PK parameters:

      P(n) (nth basic PK parameter)

 Implicit basic PK parameters:

      PK-defined variables used also in $DES block

 Additional PK parameters:

 Suppose  there  are m compartments in the system, including the output
 compartment.  For each compartment n in the system (n=1, ..., m):

      Sn - Scale for nth compartment
      S0 - Alternate name for scale for output compartment

 For each dosable compartment n in the system:

      Fn - Bioavailability for nth compartment
      Rn - Rate for nth compartment
      Dn - Duration for nth compartment
      ALAGn - Absorption lag for nth compartment

 Other additional PK parameters:

      F0 - Output fraction (also called Fm, FO)
      XSCALE - Time scale
      MTIME(i) - Model event times

 TOLERANCE values

      TOL (Relative Tolerance) is required; this can be  supplied  with
      the  $SUBROUTINE  or $TOL record, or a user-supplied TOL routine,
      which sets NRD=TOL.
      (See <A HREF="$.htm#$subroutines">$SUBROUTINES</A>).
      (See <A HREF="$.htm#$tol">$TOL</A>).

      With NONMEM 7.4, ATOL (Absolute tolerance) may be  specified  for
      ADVAN9, ADVAN13, ADVAN14, ADVAN16, ADVAN18.
      For example, $SUBROUTINE ... ATOL=n.
      The  default is 12 (that is, accuracy is 10**(-12)).  Usually the
      problem runs quickly when using this setting.  On occasion,  how-
      ever,  you  may want to reduce ATOL (usually set it equal to that
      of TOL), and improve speeds of up to 3 to 4 fold.  Values of  TOL
      and  ATOL  may  also be specified for evaluations of Steady State
      amounts, and also for the Covariance Step.

      See options ATOL, <A HREF="t.htm#tol">TOL</A>C, ATOLC, SSATOL, SSATOLC of the $SUBROUTINE
      and $TOL records.

      A  user-supplied  TOL  routine  may assign values of NRD and ANRD
      specifically for the initial (base) setting and each NONMEM  step
      (estimation,   covariance,  simulation, table/scatter step, simu-
      lation, initial parameters estimate, nonparametric).  It may also
      supply specific values for each compartment, and for Steady State
      amounts.
      (See <A HREF="t.htm#tol">TOL</A>).

      With ADVAN13, the user may find that the TOL option should  spec-
      ify larger NRD values than for other ADVANs (e.g., ADVAN6).  Val-
      ues of 7 or 8 may not be unreasonable with double precision.

      See INTRODUCTION TO NONMEM 7, Controlling  the  Accuracy  of  the
      Gradient Evaluation and Individual Objective Function Evaluation

 Reserved  variable MXSTEP (the  maximum  number  of integration steps)
 can be specified for ADVAN13 and ADVAN14 and ADVAN16.
 (See <A HREF="m.htm#mxstep">mxstep</A>).

 With ADVAN13, if there is a period of time during which some  compart-
 ment's  amount  should be zero, that compartment should be turned off.
 Otherwise, very small amounts can appear in the compartment, which can
 cause difficulties during subsequent time periods.

 By  default,  the  initial  conditions (i.e., compartment amounts) are
 zero at the start of each individual record. Different initial  condi-
 tions may be specified using a compartment initialization block in PK.
 When endogenous drug is specified in the differential equations,  non-
 zero initial conditions may also be computed using a steady-state dose
 event record with SS&gt;0 and AMT=0 and RATE=0, or using the  I_SS  (Ini-
 tial Steady State) feature of MODEL and/or PK.
 (See <A HREF="c.htm#compartment_initialization_block">Compartment_Initialization_Block</A>, <A HREF="s.htm#ss_dose_event_record">SS_dose</A>).
 (See <A HREF="$.htm#$model">$model</A>, $pk).
 (See <A HREF="m.htm#model">model</A>, <A HREF="p.htm#pk">pk</A>).
 (See <A HREF="i.htm#initial_steady_state:_i_ss_issmod">Initial_Steady_State:_I_SS</A>,ISSMOD).
