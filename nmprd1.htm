 MEANING: NONMEM-PRED global variables
 CONTEXT: PRED routine

 With versions of NONMEM before 7.4.2:

 USAGE:
      USE NMPRD_INT, ONLY: IERPRD,NETEXT

 GLOBAL DECLARATION:
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE) :: IERPRD,NETEXT

 With versions of NONMEM starting with 7.4.2:

 USAGE:
      USE NMPRD_INT, ONLY: IERPRD,IERPRDU,NETEXT

 GLOBAL DECLARATION:
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE) :: IERPRD,IERPRDU,NETEXT

 DISCUSSION:

 Values are stored by PRED for use with NONMEM.

 IERPRD
      The  PRED  error return code; also called the PRED exit code.  Is
      set to 0 before PRED is called.
      IERPRD=0: Normal return
      IERPRD=1: PRED is unable to compute.  If possible, NONMEM  should
      attempt recovery.
      IERPRD=2:  PRED  is  unable  to compute.  NONMEM should abort the
      run.

 NETEXT
      NETEXT=0 to 3: the number of lines of text of  an  error  message
      stored by PRED in ETEXT
      (See <A HREF="n.htm#nmprd2">nmprd2</A>).
      (See <A HREF="p.htm#pred_error_message">PRED Error Message</A>).

 Values may be stored in IERPRD two ways.
 PREDPP may store error messages such as
  PK  PARAMETER  FOR  KA  IS NON-POSITIVE in ETEXT and set IERPRD=1 and
 K=1.  (In effect, EXIT 1 1).

 In abbreviated code, whether or not  PREDPP  is  used,  the  statement
 "EXIT n k" causes n to be stored in IERPRD.  The value of k is part of
 the error message in ETEXT, which is reported  in  the  NONMEM  output
 report and in file PRDERR.

 With NONMEM 7.4.2, there is a new variable, IERPRDU.  Both n and k are
 stored in IERPRDU.  k must be between 0 and 999. The value  stored  is
 n*10000+k.  E.g., "EXIT 1 500" is stored in IERPRDU as 10500.

 With  NONMEM 7.5 and later, values of k between 1000 and 9999 are per-
 mitted.  E.g., "EXIT 1 2000" is stored in IERPRDU as 12000.

 PREDPP will not set these values; only the EXIT statement in  abbrevi-
 ated  code can do this.  IERPRDU is ignored if it is not the Simuation
 Step.  For NONMEM 7.5 use of the error code during simulation,
 (See <A HREF="s.htm#simulation_block">Simulation Block</A>) and look for "Simulation Error Forgiveness".
