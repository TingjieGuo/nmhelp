 MEANING: FINISH record
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN and NONMEM data sets

 USAGE:
 FIN

 DISCUSSION:
 A  FINISH  record signals the end of the data for a given NONMEM prob-
 lem.  It is always optional.

 FINISH record in NM-TRAN data sets:

      When the RECORDS option of the $DATA record is  omitted,  NM-TRAN
      reads  the  data set to a FINISH record or to end-of-file, which-
      ever comes first.

      When a format is omitted on the $DATA  record,  a  FINISH  record
      consists  of  the characters FIN appearing anywhere in the record
      (the other characters are all blank).

      When a format is provided on the $DATA record,  a  FINISH  record
      must have the same form as in NONMEM data sets.

 FINISH record in NONMEM data sets:

      When  Fields  3 and 6 of the NONMEM DATA Control Record are blank
      or zero, NONMEM reads the data set to a FINISH record or to  end-
      of-file,  whichever  comes first.  (Field 3 and 6 either contains
      the number of data records or are blank or zero.   They  must  be
      blank  or  zero  when  the  number  of  records  is  greater than
      99999999.)

      The format of the FINISH record is:

           Blank characters in positions 1-76 and 80 and the characters
           F, I, and N in positions 77, 78, and 79, respectively.

           If  m  is  the  number  of  FORTRAN records spanned per data
           record, there must be m-1  blank  FORTRAN  records  inserted
           before the FINISH record.

      In addition, the following three rules must be followed:

           All  FORTRAN records of the input data file must be 80 char-
           acters long.

           All FORTRAN records of the input data file except the FINISH
           record must have blank characters in positions 77-80.

           The  total number of A, E, and F codes on the FORMAT record,
           including their multiplicities, must equal, not exceed,  the
           number of data items specified on the DATA record.
