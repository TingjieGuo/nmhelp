<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, NONMEM calls PRED
with one data record after another, no data records being
skipped, and no record being repeated. NONMEM can be
requested to call PRED with a different sequence of records,
using the Repetition feature of NONMEM. A NONMEM reserved
data item RPT_ may be used, or reserved variables RPTO,
RPTON, PRDFL may be set in PK or ERROR (see chapter III
Section I.B). One use of this feature is for models
involving convolution. The discussion below is unaffected by
this use of feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With NONMEM each observation
(i.e. each value of the dependent variable of the regression
model) is placed on a separate data record called an
<b>observation record</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the value placed on the
record is called the <b>dependent variable</b> (DV) data
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are situations where it is
convenient to place all the values of the concomitant
variables (i.e. independent variables) needed to compute the
prediction of an observation on the same data record as that
one containing the observation. Then all data records are
observation records. There are other situations, though,
where it is convenient to organize the concomitant variables
across different data records. One situation arises when one
needs to avoid the NONMEM restriction on the number of data
items per data record. (The maximum number of data items per
data record is given by constant PD in resource/SIZES.f90.
The default value is 50. A larger value of PD may be
specified using the NM-TRAN $SIZES record.) Another
situation arises with the following example. Suppose there
is a chronology to events: at time 4 days a dose of 5 mg is
given, at time 5 days a dose of 10 mg is given, and at 7
days a plasma concentration is observed, etc. Then data may
be originally recorded in the laboratory or clinic so that
all the data items associated with an event occuring at
given time are contained on one record, with different
records for events at different times. Moreover, these
records may be time ordered. When NONMEM data records must
be constructed, it may be more convenient to construct
records that look like these. NONMEM allows this. A NONMEM
data record need not be an observation record, i.e. it need
not contain an actual observation. If there are
nonobservation data records, each record must contain a
<b>missing dependent variable</b> (MDV) data item, whose
value is 0 if the record is an observation record, and 1 if
the record is not an observation record. The DV data item is
ignored when the MDV data item is 1. It need simply be a
<b>null value</b> which serves as a place holder for the
position where an observation would be placed on an
observation record. With NONMEM 7.3, values of MDV may be
100 or 101. MDV=100 is the same as MDV=0 but tells NONMEM to
ignore the record during the Estimation and Covariance
Steps. MDV=101 is the same as MDV=1 but tells NONMEM to
ignore the record during the Estimation and Covariance
Steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDPP is concerned with time
ordered events: dose events, observation events, and other
events such as the beginning of a urine collection and a
measured change in kidney function. This routine
<i>expects</i> that there will be different data records
associated with each of the different events, and that these
data records are time ordered. Data records are also
organized into <b>individual records</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of population data
an individual record is a group of contiguous data records
all associated with the same individual and having the same
<b>identification</b> (ID) data item. In this case the time
ordering of data records expected by PREDPP refers to the
time ordering of data records <i>within</i> an individual
record. In the case of data from a single subject individual
records do not correspond on a one-to-one basis to either
animal or human subjects. An individual record is simply any
group of contiguous data records containing only one
observation record and having the same ID data item.
(Although, the presence of a multivariate observation means
the individual record containing it has several observation
records, each containing one element of the observation.) In
this case the time ordering of data records expected by
PREDPP refers to the time ordering of data records <i>across
all</i> records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To summarize the foregoing, a
typical NONMEM data set for PREDPP (the first 9 records of
which) can be illustrated thusly:</p>

<pre style="margin-top: 1em">ID      TIME    C1      C2  ...  CN      DV     MDV 1       1.     .5      10        5              1
 1       3.              9       10              1
 1       6.              6              4.1      0
 1       7.              7       10              1
 1      10.              7              5.3      0
 2       2.     .9       8        8              1
 2       2.5             6                       1
 2       6.              7                       1
 2       7.              8              6.4      0</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">where ID, MDV, and DV label the
ID, MDV, and DV data items, where TIME labels the time data
items, and where C1, C2, ..., CN label concomitant variable
data items. NONMEM itself, and not PREDPP, recognizes and
responds to ID, DV, and MDV data items. With PREDPP there
must always be time data items giving the times of the
events. (An exception occurs with ADVAN9, ADVAN15, or
ADVAN17, when there are only algebraic equations to be
solved, in which case the time data item is optional.)
PREDPP, and not NONMEM, recognizes and responds to TIME data
items. Note that some data items are left blank. In a NONMEM
data set blanks are null values and will be read by the
program as zeros, and displayed as such in tables and
scatterplots. (In an NM-TRAN data set blanks serve as a
place holder for a null value when a format is given. When a
format is not given, a dot (&rsquo; . &rsquo;) or a zero
(&rsquo; 0 &rsquo;) can be used as a place holder.) Neither
NONMEM nor PREDPP supplies nonzero values for null values,
or understands these null values as &quot;missing
values&quot;. In this illustration there are 2 individual
records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the time data
item, each event record must have a data item indicating the
type of event in question, and if, for example, the event is
a dose-type event, the event record must have additional
data items specifying certain dose type information. This is
all discussed in Chapter V. Usually, all drug dosing
information is specified in the event records, rather than
in user-supplied code. In the illustration, the event
identification data items are not shown, but the amount data
items are labeled CN, though ordinarily, they might be
labeled AMT; see section V.D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this illustration there are 9
data records corresponding to 5 different time ordered
events within the first individual record and 4 different
time ordered events within the second individual record.
Three of these events are observation events: two within the
first individual record, and one within the second
individual record. At least four of these events are dose
events (one cannot identify dose events simply by the
presence of nonzero amount data items): three within the
first individual record, and one within the second
individual record. Typically, as in the illustration, with
PREDPP each data record is also an <b>event record</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">describing a separate event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, infrequently, several
data records may be needed to describe an event.&dagger;
<br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; The CONT data
item described in this paragraph cannot be used with NM-TRAN
abbreviated code. <br>
---------- <br>
</cite></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can group a number of data
records associated with a given event into a single event
record. This is accomplished by including in each data
record a data item indicating whether or not the record and
the succeeding record are both members of the same event
record. This data item is called the <b>continuation data
item</b> (CONT data item). Its value is 1 if the data record
and the succeeding record are both members of the same event
record, and 0 otherwise (or if the data record is the last
data record). It is PREDPP that recognizes and responds to
CONT data items, and the concept of an event record is
peculiar to PREDPP, not NONMEM. If continuation data items
are not used, each data record constitutes a separate event
record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A slightly different example of
a NONMEM data set is this:</p>

<pre style="margin-top: 1em">ID     TIME     CONT    C1  ...  CN      DV      MDV 1                1     .5                        1
 1       1.       0               5               1
 1       6.       0                     4.1       0
 1       7.       0              10               1
 1      10.       0                     5.3       0
 2                1     .9                        1
 2                1                               1
 2       6.       0               8               1
 2       7.       0                     6.4       0</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the CONT data items appear.
There are 6 event records, 4 in the first individual record
and 2 in the second individual record. Both the 1st and 3rd
event records contain information needed to predict the
second observation (at time 10 hr). At time 1 hr a dose of 5
mg is given, and at 7 hr a dose of 10 mg is given. A plasma
concentration is measured at 6 hr. The time associated with
each event must appear on the last data record of the
corresponding event record; it need not appear elsewhere in
the event record.</p>
