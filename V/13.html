<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 13 -
Errors in NONMEM Runs</b></p>

<h2>1. What This Chapter is About
<a name="1."></a>
<a name="1. What This Chapter is About"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This chapter describes
error messages that can appear in NONMEM&rsquo;s output and
discusses some possible causes and remedies. It is not
encyclopedic; only selected messages are discussed. NM-TRAN
messages are meant to be self-explanatory, as are many
PREDPP messages, and important NONMEM messages are
documented in NONMEM Users Guide, Part I, Chapter G. Unlike
certain other regression programs, NONMEM-PREDPP will not
try to mask what is perceived as a real problem and to which
attention must be given by the user before the computation
can proceed; an error message results and often, the program
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Estimation and
Covariance Steps do not always terminate successfully. This
is a normal part of the process of model
building.</p>

<h2>2. Abnormal Termination of the Estimation Step
<a name="2."></a>
<a name="2. Abnormal Termination of the Estimation Step"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal termination of the
Estimation Step is indicated by the message:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>MINIMIZATION
SUCCESSFUL</b></tt></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even when this message is
seen, it is possible that the Estimation Step has not run
correctly. Final estimates should be different from initial
estimates. If the initial and final estimates are the same
and the gradients for a parameter are zero at every
iteration&dagger;, this is a sign of a modelling error. The
parameter does not affect any predictions, as discussed in
Chapter 7, Section 4.2. If there were bounds, estimates
should be well away from the bounds. A final estimate which
is close to a bound is discussed in Chapter 11, Section 4.3.
<br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; A gradient
may reach zero at or near the final iteration; this is not
an error. Note also that no gradient is computed or printed
for a parameter whose value is fixed, so if a gradient is
always zero, it is not for this reason. <br>
---------- <br>
</cite></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abnormal termination of
the Estimation Step is indicated by a message whose first
line is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>MINIMIZATION
TERMINATED</b></tt></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of several messages
will follow, indicating the type of failure. The messages
are listed in Users Guide I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two of the most common
are discussed here separately.</p>

<h3>2.1. &quot;DUE TO MAX. NO. OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONSEXCEEDED&quot;
<a name="2.1."></a>
<a name="2.1. &quot;DUE TO MAX. NO. OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONSEXCEEDED&quot;"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If after any iteration
the total number of evaluations of the objective function
(Chapter 10, figure 10.5, line 33) is equal to or greater
than the maximum allowed (Chapter 10, figure 10.2, line 51),
the minimization search is halted with this message. If the
$ESTIMATION record requested that a Model Specification File
be written, it is possible to continue the search from this
point in a subsequent NONMEM run. In Chapter 12, Section
4.3, a strategy is discussed by which the number of function
evaluations is deliberately set to a low value in order to
structure a lengthy run as a series of shorter
runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever this message is
obtained, it is important to examine the intermediate output
and evaluate the progress made so far. A poorly-specified
model, for example, may cause very slow convergence of the
minimization search. Raising the maximum number of function
evaluations (using the MAXEVAL option of the $ESTIMATION
record) may not be advisable.</p>

<h3>2.2. &quot;DUE TO ROUNDING ERRORS (ERROR=134)&quot;
<a name="2.2."></a>
<a name="2.2. &quot;DUE TO ROUNDING ERRORS (ERROR=134)&quot;"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This message will be
accompanied in the intermediate output by a message
beginning: NUMSIGDIG: .... which gives the
approximate number of significant digits obtained in each of
the parameters being estimated. At least one such number
will be less than the number requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of significant
digits obtained should be examined. If it is at least 2, and
the gradient vector appears stable throughout the last few
iterations, a satisfactory minimum may well have been
obtained. (It may be desirable to re-run the problem with
the print interval for iteration summarization set to 1
(PRINT=1 in the $ESTIMATION record) so that the progress
made at every iteration can be examined.) The final
parameter estimates should be examined, and if they appear
reasonable, they might be accepted. Although the user may
have requested more than 2 significant digits, the data may
only support about 2 digits, given the precision of the
arithmetic being used. By examining the gradients carefully,
it is often possible to obtain further information about
which parameter estimates are less-well
determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though the final
parameter estimates may be adequate, it is unlikely that the
minimum is sufficiently well-determined to allow the
Covariance Step to run successfully, at least with the
number of significant figures requested in the Estimation
Step. The Estimation Step may need to be rerun, requesting
only 2 significant figures, followed by the Covariance
Step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the number of
significant digits is less than 2 (or even negative), then
the final estimates should not be trusted. The problem may
be model misspecification or insufficient data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Model misspecification is
a very general problem involving some mismatch between the
model and the data. This can result in particularly large
values of the objective function or slow convergence of the
minimization search. Sometimes the model is
overparameterized. This means that the model has more
parameters than can be well-enough estimated from the data
(e.g., a biexponential model is fit to monoexponential
data). When model misspecification occurs due to
over-parameterization, then the Estimation Step will usually
proceed smoothly, but terminate with fewer than 2
significant digits. It is best to start with simple models
(see Chapter 11).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A related problem arises
when a covariance element, e.g.,
<img src="grohtml-152838-3.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-3.png">
(or
<img src="grohtml-152838-4.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-4.png">
), is being estimated. If the ID (or L2 data item) is not
used correctly, it may appear as though the covariance does
not affect objective function values, and then this
parameter will not be well estimated. In other words, it may
appear as though the model is overparameterized due to the
inclusion of this parameter. See Chapter 12, Section
4.2.</p>

<h2>3. Abnormal Termination of the Covariance Step
<a name="3."></a>
<a name="3. Abnormal Termination of the Covariance Step"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible for the
Estimation Step to terminate successfully, and yet the
Covariance Step generates an error message. Error messages
from the Covariance Step are printed immediately after line
46 of Figure 10.5. The messages are listed in Users Guide
I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a message arises,
often it is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>R MATRIX
ALGORITHMICALLY NON-POSITIVE-SEMIDEFINITE <br>
BUT NONSINGULAR <br>
COVARIANCE STEP ABORTED</b></tt></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for the
minimization routine to terminate successfully, it needs to
determine that the final gradient vector is sufficiently
small, which is a necessary condition for a minimum to have
been achieved. This condition, however, is not sufficient. A
sufficient condition, that the R matrix be positive definite
(and therefore, that the apparent minimum not be a saddle
point) is only checked in the Covariance Step. The message
means that the sufficient condition appears not to be
satisfied. The final estimate is, therefore, in
doubt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the message
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><tt><b>R MATRIX
ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR <br>
COVARIANCE STEP UNOBTAINABLE <br>
S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY
SINGULAR</b></tt></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This arises when there
exists a parameter whose values do not actually affect the
predictions and whose gradient in the intermediate output is
always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, successful
completion of the Covariance Step requires a better defined
minimum than does the successful completion of the
Estimation Step.</p>

<h2>4. Miscellaneous Problems
<a name="4."></a>
<a name="4. Miscellaneous Problems"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section discusses a
few simple errors which prevent NONMEM-PREDPP from running
successfully.</p>

<h3>4.1. Proportional Error Model
<a name="4.1."></a>
<a name="4.1. Proportional Error Model"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common error is to use
the proportional error model while some predicted values for
actual observations are zero or close to zero. (For example,
if the first dose is an infusion and there is a
&quot;baseline&quot; observation at the start of the
infusion, the predicted level will be zero.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With individual data this
will lead to an error message similar to the following (the
individual number may be different from 1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM TERMINATED
BY OBJ, ERROR IN ELS <br>
WITH INDIVIDUAL 1 (IN INDIVIDUAL RECORD ORDERING) <br>
VAR-COV OF DATA FROM INDIVIDUAL RECORD ESTIMATED TO BE
SINGULAR</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With population data this
will lead to an error message similar to the following (the
individual and record numbers may be different than
1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM TERMINATED
BY OBJ, ERROR IN CELS <br>
WITH INDIVIDUAL 1 (IN INDIVIDUAL RECORD ORDERING) <br>
INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIANCE OF DATA FROM OBS RECORD 1 ESTIMATED
TO BE 0</small></p>

<h3>4.2. Errors in the Pharmacokinetic Model
<a name="4.2."></a>
<a name="4.2. Errors in the Pharmacokinetic Model"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using a new model, a
run should done in which the Estimation Step is not run, and
a scatterplot of PRED vs DV with unit slope line is
produced, to verify that the model and the initial parameter
estimates are reasonable. It is much harder to diagnose
errors in the model or the initial estimates after the
Estimation Step fails. Make sure that the initial value of
the objective function is not excessively large, and that
the unit slope line shows on the plot: scaling errors can
easily go undetected! E.g., if the units are incorrect at
some point in the model (L vs ml), the predictions may be
wrong by a factor of 1000. Similarly, if no scale was
specified for the compartment being observed, the
predictions for the observations are compartment amounts
rather than concentrations. In both cases, the shape of the
PRED vs DV plot may appear linear, but the axes may be
labeled quite differently. When observations from two
different compartments are present in the data (e.g.,
<img src="grohtml-152838-5.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-5.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-6.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-6.png">
), some of the observations may be scaled incorrectly. This
is discussed in Chapter 6, Section 9, and Chapter 7, Section
4.3.3.</p>

<h2>5. Errors with PREDPP
<a name="5."></a>
<a name="5. Errors with PREDPP"></a>
</h2>


<h3>5.1. Error Messages from a TRANS Routine
<a name="5.1."></a>
<a name="5.1. Error Messages from a TRANS Routine"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANS routines can
produce error messages. Here is one from TRANS2: <br>
ERROR IN TRANS2 ROUTINE: V IS ZERO <br>
Appendix 2 shows that TRANS2 normally computes
<tt>K=CL/V</tt>. The routine checks that V is not zero, and
upon finding that it is, it prints the informative message,
and terminates the run (thus avoiding a machine
&quot;division by zero&quot; interrupt by the operating
system). This error usually occurs with the initial
parameter estimates. E.g., suppose the relevant $PK
statement is: <tt><b><br>
V=THETA(1)+WT*THETA(2)</b></tt> <br>
For some values of
<img src="grohtml-152838-7.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-7.png">
,
<img src="grohtml-152838-8.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-8.png">
, and WT, a value of zero is being computed for V. The
initial estimates of
<img src="grohtml-152838-9.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-9.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-10.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-10.png">
should be checked. The intercept
<img src="grohtml-152838-11.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-11.png">
might have been fixed to zero, in which case then, the
values of WT should also be checked. If WT is recorded only
on the first event record of each individual&rsquo;s data,
careful coding is required to insure that a value of zero is
not used when the $PK record is evaluated with subsequent
event records.</p>

<h3>5.2. Error Messages from ADVAN Routines
<a name="5.2."></a>
<a name="5.2. Error Messages from ADVAN Routines"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar error message
can be generated in PREDPP, e.g. <br>
PK PARAMETER FOR OBSERVATION COMPARTMENT&rsquo;S SCALE IS
ZERO <br>
Some scale parameter is modeled in such a way as to produce
a zero. Again, the code for that scale parameter, and the
initial estimates for the
<img src="grohtml-152838-12.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-12.png">
&rsquo;s used therein, should be checked. Perhaps the scale
parameter is being set equal to a volume parameter, and as
described above, the volume parameter is being set to zero.
When TRANS1 is used, the volume parameter is neither
recognized nor checked.</p>

<h3>5.3. Numeric difficulties in PREDPP
<a name="5.3."></a>
<a name="5.3. Numeric difficulties in PREDPP"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric difficulties can
occur with linear pharmacokinetic models (e.g., ADVAN1-4) in
the process of computing certain exponentials. They can
occur from an error in the units of either a rate constant
and/or the TIME data items. They can also occur from
inordinately large values for a rate constant which arise
during the minimization search. This might be avoided by
placing appropriate constraints on
<img src="grohtml-152838-13.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-13.png">
&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They can also occur when
the system is advanced over an excessively long period of
time. This can happen within an individual record, when the
individual had a course of drug treatment, followed by a
wash-out period, followed by another course of drug
treatment. The first dose record of treatment courses other
than the first should have EVID data item equal to 4
(reset-dose) rather than 1 (dose), to avoid computing
excessively small compartment amounts (see Chapter 6,
Section 7.3), and to reduce computational cost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Difficulties can occur in
the process of computing predictions with ADVAN2 and ADVAN4
when values of KA and K arise during the minimization search
that are very close to one another. The models encoded into
the ADVAN routines assume that KA and K have fairly distinct
values, and the formulas for the predictions have the term
KA-K in the denominator. If, for example, the typical values
of K and KA are associated with
<img src="grohtml-152838-14.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-14.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-15.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-15.png">
, respectively, then one might try reparameterizing. The
typical values of K and KA-K can be associated with
<img src="grohtml-152838-16.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-16.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-17.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-17.png">
, so that
<img src="grohtml-152838-18.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-18.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-19.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-19.png">
. A lower bound of zero should be placed on
<img src="grohtml-152838-20.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-20.png">
&dagger;. <br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; This
technique also prevents a &quot;flip-flop&quot; from
occurring. (In the original parameterization, the final
estimates of
<img src="grohtml-152838-21.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-21.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-152838-22.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-22.png">
can be the final estimates of the typical values of KA and
K, respectively). <br>
---------- <br>
</cite></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar situation
occurs with TRANS3, where VSS-V occurs in the denominator of
the expression for K21. As above, reparameterization and a
constraint on an element of
<img src="grohtml-152838-23.png" alt="Image grohtml-152838-23.png">
may help.</p>
