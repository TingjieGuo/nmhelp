<DIV style="position:absolute;top:93;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">This edition of &quot;NONMEM Users Guide - Part V Introductory Guide&quot; is distributed with NONMEM 7.2. It<br>is the ﬁrst new edition since 1994. Details that have changed since the previous edition have been cor-<br>rected, and some new features have been added.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:132;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1">Signiﬁcant changes are marked with bars.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:152;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">Examples of NONMEM outputs have not been updated. They remain as they were in 1994 and are from<br>NONMEM IV. With later versions of NONMEM there are changes in the outputs. In some cases the<br>wording has been changed; there is new content; and the numerical results may have changed slightly. But<br>none of this affects the features and methodology that Lewis Sheiner described in chapters 2, 10, and 11.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:203;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2">True to its purpose as an instructional guide for new users of NONMEM, this Guide remains oriented to the<br>classic NONMEM methods and basic features (through NONMEM VI). References to even earlier ver-<br>sions of NONMEM and PREDPP have been deleted.</span></nobr></DIV>
