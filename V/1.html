<h2>NONMEM Users Guide Part V - Introductory Guide - Chapter 1

<a name="NONMEM Users Guide Part V - Introductory Guide - Chapter 1"></a>
</h2>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 1 -
Introduction to NONMEM, PREDPP, and NM-TRAN</b></p>

<h2>1. What This Chapter is About
<a name="1."></a>
<a name="1. What This Chapter is About"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This chapter introduces a
computer program called NONMEM. It also introduces two
programs that are distributed with NONMEM and make it easier
to use: PREDPP and NM-TRAN. The scope of this text itself is
described, and suggestions are made for reading it. A
somewhat detailed technical description of the components of
NONMEM is then given. The final section is a list of
additional references.</p>

<h2>2. Introducing NONMEM
<a name="2."></a>
<a name="2. Introducing NONMEM"></a>
</h2>


<h3>2.1. What is NONMEM?
<a name="2.1."></a>
<a name="2.1. What is NONMEM?"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONMEM stands for
&quot;Nonlinear Mixed Effects Model.&quot; NONMEM is a
computer program, written in FORTRAN 90/95, designed to fit
general statistical (nonlinear) regression-type models to
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONMEM was developed by
the NONMEM Project Group at the University of California at
San Francisco for analyzing population pharmacokinetic data
in particular.&dagger; <br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; NONMEM
versions up through VI are the property of the Regents of
the University of California, but ICON Development Solutions
has exclusive rights to license their use. NONMEM 7 is the
current version of the software and is the property of ICON
Development Solutions. <br>
---------- <br>
</cite></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are data typically
collected from clinical studies of pharmaceutic agents,
involving the administration of a drug to individuals and
the subsequent observation of drug levels (most often in the
blood plasma). Proper modeling of these data involves
accounting for both unexplainable inter- and intra-subject
effects (random effects), as well as measured concomitant
effects (fixed effects). NONMEM allows this mixed effect
modeling. Such modeling is especially useful when there are
only a few pharmacokinetic measurements from each individual
sampled in the population, or when the data collection
design varies considerably between these individuals.
However, NONMEM is a general program which can be used to
fit models to a wide variety of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like many nonlinear
regression programs, NONMEM does not have any &quot;built
in&quot; models (such as the linear model) with which it can
compute a predicted value given the current values of the
regression parameters. Instead, NONMEM calls a subroutine
having entry name PRED (&quot;prediction&quot;) to obtain a
predicted value. PRED also must compute for NONMEM partial
derivatives with respect to certain random variables.
Depending on the model and the kinds of doses, PRED may be
very simple or may be very complicated. A user can write his
own PRED subroutine. This can be as simple or complicated as
is necessary, and may involve calls to its own
subprograms.</p>

<h3>2.2. What is PREDPP?
<a name="2.2."></a>
<a name="2.2. What is PREDPP?"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDPP stands for
&quot;PRED for Population Pharmacokinetics&quot;. It is a
PRED subroutine for use with NONMEM and is the second major
component distributed with NONMEM. Whereas NONMEM is a
general nonlinear regression tool, PREDPP is specialized to
the kinds of predictions which arise in pharmacokinetic data
analysis. It can compute predictions according to many
different pharmacokinetic models, according to a great
variety of dosing regimens. Almost all the examples in this
guide use PREDPP.</p>

<h3>2.3. What is NM-TRAN?
<a name="2.3."></a>
<a name="2.3. What is NM-TRAN?"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN stands for
&quot;NONMEM Translator&quot;. It is the third major
component distributed with NONMEM. It is a separate,
&quot;stand-alone&quot; control language translator and data
preprocessor. When NM-TRAN is used, a NONMEM run includes
two separate steps: first the NM-TRAN step, in which a file
of NM-TRAN records (which begin with &quot;$&quot;) are
translated into several NONMEM input files, and second the
NONMEM step itself. All the examples in this guide use
NM-TRAN. We strongly recommend its use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that neither NM-TRAN
nor NONMEM-PREDPP run interactively. Files of commands and
data are created by means of (say) the operating system
editor. Then NM-TRAN and NONMEM are executed, using these
files as input. Figure 1.1 shows the relationship between
NONMEM, PREDPP, and NM-TRAN.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="+chapt1/fig1.1.ubuntu.epsi.png" alt="Image +chapt1/fig1.1.ubuntu.epsi.png"></p>

<h3>2.4. Scope of this Introductory Guide
<a name="2.4."></a>
<a name="2.4. Scope of this Introductory Guide"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This Guide is intended to
be read by new users of NONMEM-PREDPP. Typically, such users
have pharmacokinetic data, either from a population or from
a single individual&dagger;, <br>
----------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><cite>&dagger; The terms
&quot;population&quot; and &quot;single individual&quot; are
used in this guide. NM-TRAN and NONMEM outputs refer to
POPULATION and SINGLE-SUBJECT data and analysis. <br>
---------- <br>
</cite></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to be fit to a standard
pharmacokinetic model (e.g., a one or two compartment linear
mammillary model). However, new users with nonstandard
models, or with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, may
also find this guide helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is assumed that NONMEM
and its components are already installed on the user&rsquo;s
computer and that the user wants to learn to use them as
quickly as possible. This guide does not tell how to perform
the installation or how to run an installed NONMEM under a
particular operating system; the new user will have to ask
experienced users what the local commands are. However,
someone who is installing NONMEM at a new site may find it
useful to review this guide to get a quick overview of
NONMEM, its component programs, its inputs, and its
outputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This guide is not a text
book in pharmacokinetics or statistics. Readers should be
familiar with basic concepts in pharmacokinetics and
statistical data analysis. We also assume a very basic
familiarity with FORTRAN.</p>

<h3>2.5. Contents of this Introductory Guide
<a name="2.5."></a>
<a name="2.5. Contents of this Introductory Guide"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 2</b> contains
two examples of the use of NONMEM. The first presents data
from a single individual; estimates are obtained of his
pharmacokinetic parameters. The second presents data from a
group of individuals; estimates are obtained of the
pharmacokinetic parameters of the population which this
group represents. The examples serve to introduce NONMEM
notation, input and output, and to provide an idea of what
is possible using the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 3</b> presents
the notation and definitions we will use to discuss models
for individual data. The relationship of these models to
data is discussed, and the distinction between so-called
fixed effects and random effects is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 4</b> extends
this discussion to models for population data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 5</b>
discusses NONMEM&rsquo;s fitting criterion, the parameter
estimates obtained by using this criterion, and the standard
errors of these estimates. It then discusses how to do
hypothesis tests with NONMEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 6</b> tells
how to create data files for NONMEM-PREDPP and how to
describe them using the $DATA and $INPUT records of NM-TRAN.
It also discusses the Data Preprocessor feature of
NM-TRAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 7</b> tells
how to use NM-TRAN to write simple $SUBROUTINE records for
PREDPP, how to write $PK records for individual data, and
how to write $PK records for population data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 8</b> tells
how to write simple $ERROR records for PREDPP. Chapters 7
and 8 are meant to be read in parallel with Chapters 3 and
4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 9</b> tells
how to use NM-TRAN to specify the remaining choices for an
analysis. It tells how to assign initial values to
parameters ($THETA, $OMEGA, $SIGMA records), how to specify
what analysis tasks to perform ($ESTIMATION, $COVARIANCE
records), and how to specify certain additional output
($TABLE, $SCATTERPLOT records).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 10</b>
describes NONMEM&rsquo;s output in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 11</b>
outlines the process of model building, showing how a simple
model can be made more complex to better fit the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 12</b> briefly
describes a variety of features of PREDPP and NONMEM that
are somewhat advanced for this text but are of interest to
most users of NONMEM. References are given to other
documents in which additional information can be
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Chapter 13</b>
discusses errors that can occur during a NONMEM
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Appendix 1</b>
describes PREDPP&rsquo;s most commonly used pharmacokinetic
models (ADVAN subroutines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Appendix 2</b>
describes alternative parameterizations (TRANS subroutines)
for these models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Appendix 3</b> is a
list of NM-TRAN records.</p>

<h3>2.6. How to Read this Guide
<a name="2.6."></a>
<a name="2.6. How to Read this Guide"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Readers who are
completely new to NONMEM should read this guide starting
with Chapter 2; the examples presented are used again in the
later chapters. Chapters 2-5 are theoretical in nature.
Chapters 6-12 describe the details of building the input for
NONMEM-PREDPP and interpreting the output. Readers who have
non-pharmacokinetic data to fit can skip (or skim) Chapters
3, 4, 7, and 8. Readers who already have some familiarity
with certain topics (e.g., who have used other nonlinear
analysis programs to analyze data) can concentrate on the
chapters of interest to them. We strongly recommend that all
users &quot;graduate&quot; to the more thorough NONMEM
documentation listed in Section 4 of this
chapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Throughout the guide,
examples are given of NM-TRAN records. These examples appear
in boldface: <tt><b><br>
$THETA .01</b></tt> <br>
Examples are also given of (fragments) of input data files.
They appear as follows: <tt><b><br>
ID AMT TIME DV <br>
2 320. 0. 0. <br>
2 0. .27 1.71</b></tt> <br>
Alphabetic characters such as ID, AMT, etc., are shown for
descriptive purposes. They are <i>not</i> part of the actual
data file.</p>

<h2>3. A Brief Technical Overview
<a name="3."></a>
<a name="3. A Brief Technical Overview"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this section we
discuss the components of NONMEM in some detail. First-time
readers may prefer to skip this section and go directly to
Chapter 2, which gives an example of a NONMEM run, and
return to this section later (if at all).</p>

<h3>3.1. NONMEM
<a name="3.1."></a>
<a name="3.1. NONMEM"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONMEM is written
(almost) entirely in ANSI FORTRAN 90/95. It is distributed
on CD-ROM as FORTRAN source code, some of which is
encrypted. It can be compiled and run on any computer which
has a FORTRAN 90/95 compiler and sufficient memory and speed
to run a large, computationally intensive
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONMEM consists of a main
program and many subroutines, all of which are required for
each NONMEM run. As discussed above, one subroutine, PRED,
is not included in NONMEM itself.</p>

<h3>3.2. PREDPP and the PREDPP Library
<a name="3.2."></a>
<a name="3.2. PREDPP and the PREDPP Library"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDPP is not a single
subroutine. It is a collection of FORTRAN subroutines. Some
of these are always needed but must be supplied by the user
himself (see PK and ERROR below). Others are always needed
and are supplied; these are called the kernel routines.
Others (subroutines ADVAN and TRANS, for example) are also
always needed, and are supplied, but are chosen from
different versions corresponding to different
pharmacokinetic models. The collection of supplied routines
constitutes the PREDPP Library.</p>

<h3>3.3. Subroutines PK and ERROR
<a name="3.3."></a>
<a name="3.3. Subroutines PK and ERROR"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two very important
subroutines of PREDPP are called PK and ERROR. PK computes
the values of the population or individual pharmacokinetic
parameters (e.g., CL and V) of a given model and accounts
for the &quot;differences&quot; between individual and
population values. ERROR accounts for the
&quot;differences&quot; between predicted and observed
values. These two subroutines are where the basic task of
modelling is carried out; this task is the user&rsquo;s
responsibility. Chapters 7 and 8 are devoted to a
description of these subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 1.2 shows the
major components of PREDPP.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="+chapt1/fig1.2.ubuntu.epsi.png" alt="Image +chapt1/fig1.2.ubuntu.epsi.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 1.2.
Components of PREDPP. ADVAN and TRANS are chosen from the
PREDPP library. PK and ERROR are
user-supplied.</small></p>

<h3>3.4. Building an Executable Module for NONMEM
<a name="3.4."></a>
<a name="3.4. Building an Executable Module for NONMEM"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether PREDPP is used or
a special purpose PRED subroutine is written, the PRED
subroutine must be combined (&quot;linked&quot;) with
NONMEM; this process (which is sometimes is called
&quot;link editing&quot; or &quot;loading&quot;) must take
place before the actual NONMEM run. The NONMEM-PRED
combination is generally called a &quot;load module&quot; or
&quot;executable module&quot;. Compiling and linking are
processes which are operating system dependent; each
installation must supply its own commands and procedures for
these tasks. They may be done before the NM-TRAN step or
between it and the NONMEM step. This choice is discussed in
Section 3.7 below. For certain platforms, a front-end
interface provided by the NONMEM Project Group (nmfe74.bat
for MS/DOS; nmfe74 C-shell script for Unix-type) can be used
to perform these steps, and can create all both types of
load modules described below: generated subroutines and
user-written subroutines.</p>

<h3>3.5. NM-TRAN
<a name="3.5."></a>
<a name="3.5. NM-TRAN"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN provides the
following services: control language translation, model
specification via FORTRAN-like statements (called
abbreviated code), partial differentiation, and
preprocessing of the data. They are discussed
separately.</p>

<h3>3.6. Control Language Translation
<a name="3.6."></a>
<a name="3.6. Control Language Translation"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN includes a
language for communicating control information to NONMEM.
NM-TRAN records are free-form (i.e., spacing between options
within a record and the order of the records and their
options is flexible) and use English words (or their
abbreviations) for options. For example, the record name
$ESTIMATION may be abbreviated to $EST; the option name
SIGDIGITS may be abbreviated to SIG. Either spaces or commas
may be used to separate options. Defaults are understood for
most options, allowing the records to be relatively compact.
Considerable error checking is performed by NM-TRAN. This
reduces the number and severity of the errors that can occur
during the NONMEM run. NM-TRAN also produces messages that
warn the user of possible errors in the data and/or control
stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN translates a file
of NM-TRAN control records into NONMEM control records,
which use a fixed-field, predominately numerical control
language.</p>

<h3>3.7. Model Specification via Abbreviated Code
<a name="3.7."></a>
<a name="3.7. Model Specification via Abbreviated Code"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">With PREDPP, FORTRAN
subroutines PK and ERROR are needed to specify parts of the
pharmacostatistical model. In most cases, these
specifications can be directly expressed within NM-TRAN
records $PK and $ERROR, using FORTRAN-like assignment and
conditional statements called abbreviated code. These
statements are implemented by NM-TRAN as complete FORTRAN
subroutines in file FSUBS, incorporating the abbreviated
code. An intermediate step between the NM-TRAN and NONMEM
steps is needed to compile these subroutines and link them
with NONMEM-PREDPP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message
&quot;Recompiling certain components&quot; will be displayed
at the console at this step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 1.3 shows how the
compile and link step relates to the two steps of Figure
1.1.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="+chapt1/fig1.3.ubuntu.epsi.png" alt="Image +chapt1/fig1.3.ubuntu.epsi.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Figure 1.3.
Building a NONMEM load module with generated FORTRAN
subroutines. An intermediate step is placed between the two
steps of Figure 1.1.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the user supplies
complete PK and ERROR subroutines (i.e., $PK and $ERROR
records are not used), then the NONMEM load module can be
built at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even when
PREDPP is not used, the same options exist. For example, if
the desired model can be expressed via a $PRED record, then
NM-TRAN will generate a complete PRED subroutine. However,
whereas NM-TRAN&rsquo;s FORTRAN-like syntax is sufficient
for most purposes of writing PK and ERROR subroutines, it is
not sufficient for writing any but the simplest of PRED
subroutines.</p>

<h3>3.8. Partial Differentiation
<a name="3.8."></a>
<a name="3.8. Partial Differentiation"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONMEM requires that PRED
(whether PREDPP or user-written) compute more than just
predicted values. It must also compute certain partial
derivatives with respect to the random variables
<img src="grohtml-146191-6.png" alt="Image grohtml-146191-6.png">
and
<img src="grohtml-146191-7.png" alt="Image grohtml-146191-7.png">
described in Chapters 3 and 4. When $PK, $ERROR, or $PRED
records are used, NM-TRAN performs symbolic differentiation
to generate the code needed to compute these derivatives.
This relieves the user of a major burden.</p>

<h3>3.9. Data Preprocessor
<a name="3.9."></a>
<a name="3.9. Data Preprocessor"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NM-TRAN includes a Data
Preprocessor program which allows the user greater
flexibility in constructing his data file than is allowed in
a data file input directly into NONMEM. This is discussed in
Chapter 6.</p>
