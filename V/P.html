<h2>NONMEM Users Guide Part V - Introductory Guide - Chapter P</h2>

<p><b>Preface</b></p>

<p>This edition of &quot;NONMEM Users Guide - Part V
Introductory Guide&quot; is distributed with NONMEM 7.2. It
is the first new edition since 1994. Details that have
changed since the previous edition have been corrected, and
some new features have been added.</p>

<p>Significant changes are marked with
bars.</p>

<p>Examples of NONMEM outputs have not been updated.
They remain as they were in 1994 and are from NONMEM IV.
With later versions of NONMEM there are changes in the
outputs. In some cases the wording has been changed; there
is new content; and the numerical results may have changed
slightly. But none of this affects the features and
methodology that Lewis Sheiner described in chapters 2, 10,
and 11.</p>

<p>True to its purpose as an instructional guide for
new users of NONMEM, this Guide remains oriented to the
classic NONMEM methods and basic features (through NONMEM
VI). References to even earlier versions of NONMEM and
PREDPP have been deleted.</p>
