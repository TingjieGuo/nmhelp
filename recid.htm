 These  examples  illustrate  the  use  of the RECORDS=ID option of the
 $DATA record.  (See <A HREF="$.htm#$data">$data</A>).

 Example 1 - Data checkout

 During a checkout phase, one might want to see  only  the  predictions
 for  the  first  individual record, and therefore, use a data set com-
 prised only of the data records therein. With RECS=ID, it is not  nec-
 essary to count the number of records in the fist individual record.

 $DATA filename RECS=ID

 Example 2 - Data Analysis

 One  might  want  to  analyze each subject's data independently of the
 others.  One way this can be done is  by  creating  a  single  control
 stream  with  as  many problems as there are individual records in the
 data, and including one each of the following series of $DATA  records
 in the series of problem specifications:

 $DATA filename RECS=n1
 $DATA filename RECS=n2 NOREWIND
 $DATA filename RECS=n3 NOREWIND
 etc.

 where  "nk" is the number of records in the kth individual record.  It
 would be necessary to count the exact number of records.   Now,  these
 records can simply be coded

 $DATA filename RECS=ID
 $DATA filename RECS=ID NOREWIND
 $DATA filename RECS=ID NOREWIND
 etc.

 Example 3 - Use of  the INCLUDE record

 With  the INCLUDE record, the filename may now be followed by an inte-
 ger n, whose default value is 1.  Then NM-TRAN reads n copies  of  the
 named file.

 In  the  example  above  if the problem specification for all subjects
 after the first are completely identical, a compact way of writing the
 control  stream  is  possible.   The  control stream would contain the
 problem specification for the first individual, including the $SUBROU-
 TINES  record,  abbreviated  code,  and the $DATA record for the first
 subject, and would end with (if there are e.g. 12 subjects in all)

 INCLUDE ctlfile2 11

 The file ctlfile2 would contain one problem  specification  (including |
 $PROBLEM)  for one subject, with no $SUBROUTINES record or abbreviated
 code, but would include

 $DATA filename RECS=ID NOREWIND

 A fully worked-out example is supplied as recid2.exa (See <A HREF="r.htm#recs">recid2.exa</A>). |

 An alternate approach for single-subject data is available with NONMEM |
 7.  OMEGA diagonal values are fixed to a special value 1.0E+06.        |

 with Unconstrained ETAs ".
