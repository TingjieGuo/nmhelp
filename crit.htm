 MEANING: CRIT subroutine
 CONTEXT: User-supplied subroutine; replaces a NONMEM routine

 USAGE:
      SUBROUTINE CRIT (ICALL,J,N,WRES,V)
      USE SIZES, ONLY: ISIZE,DPSIZE
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE), INTENT(IN)     :: J,N
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE), INTENT(IN)     :: ICALL
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE),   INTENT(OUT)    :: V
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE),   INTENT(IN)     :: WRES(*)
      END SUBROUTINE CRIT

 DISCUSSION:
 The  CRIT  subroutine  is used to modify the NONMEM objective function
 used with the First-Order (or the Extended Least  Squares)  Estimation
 method.   This  objective function may be regarded as being the sum of
 contributions computed from each individual record.  The first term in
 the contribution from an individual record is independent of data, but
 the second term in the contribution is the sum of the squared weighted
 residuals  for  the  data in the record.  The weights are functions of
 the model parameters and are obtained so that  with  a  given  set  of
 parameter  values,  assumed  to  be  the  true  parameter values, each
 weighted residual has unit variance and all the weighted residuals are
 mutually  uncorrelated.   With  the  CRIT  routine,  a function of the
 weighted residuals other than the sum of their squares may be  substi-
 tuted  for  the second term.  The function may vary between individual
 records.  The CRIT routine is called by  NONMEM  with  one  individual
 record  after  another  (individual  records  without observations are
 skipped).

 Input argument:

 ICALL
      Similar to ICALL for PRED subroutine.
      0 - First call to CRIT in the run
      1 - First call to CRIT in the current problem
      2 - Computation of function value required

 J    Number of individual record

 N    Number of observations in the individual record

 WRES Vector of weighted residuals (as  many  residuals  as  there  are
      observations)

 Output argument:

 V    Value of function

 Note:  When a user CRIT is supplied, NONMEM subroutine CELS may not be
 called.
