 MEANING: MODULE for NONMEM and its components.
 CONTEXT: Source code

 DISCUSSION:
 File  SIZES is supplied on the NONMEM distribution media and is copied
 to the resources directory.  It contains FORTRAN PARAMETER  statements
 giving  the default values of symbolic parameters used in source code.
 Constants from SIZES may be incorporated into the source code by means
 of  the FORTRAN USE statement.  Some of these constants describe array
 sizes.

 With NONMEM 7.2 and higher, there are  several  changes  vs.  previous
 releases.

      There  is  only  one version of SIZES (i.e., there is no longer a
      SIZES_reg or SIZES_big).

      Many NONMEM and NM-TRAN arrays are allocated dynamically  at  run
      time.

      NM-TRAN  creates  a  subroutine FSIZESR for NONMEM.  FSIZESR con- |
      tains values for some parameters (e.g.,  LVR)  that  are  exactly |
      what  is  needed  for  the  current problem, and contains 0's for |
      parameters that NM-TRAN cannot assess.  Default values for param- |
      eters  that are 0 in FSIZESR are obtained by NONMEM from the file |
      SIZES.f90.                                                        |

      Note that file FSIZES is a  convenient  reference  for  users  to |
      view,  but  is  not used.  SUBROUTINE FSIZESR in FSUBS is what is |
      actually used during the NONMEM run.

      NM-TRAN creates a file prsizes.f90 for PREDPP.  PREDPP arrays are
      allocated  statically  but  may  be re-compiled at run time using
      parameters defined in prsizes.f90.  Some constants in prsizes are
      assessed  for the current problem; others are copied from default
      values in SIZES.f90.

      The user may override many of the parameter values in FSIZES  and
      prsizes  with  the  $SIZES record.  Any value specified by $SIZES
      will override both the default in SIZES.f90 and  the  value  that
      NM-TRAN would have specified.
      (See <A HREF="$.htm#$sizes">$sizes</A>)
      As  of NONMEM 7.3, NMTRAN determines the maximum number of obser- |
      vation records (MDV=0) that occur in any subject, among all  data |
      files  used  in the entire control stream file.  If this value is |
      greater than the NO value listed in SIZES.f90, it will set NO  to |
      this larger size.  Thus, users no longer have to be conscientious |
      of sizing the NO parameter. However, there is no  guarantee  that |
      NMTRAN  will correctly assess NO for the entire scope of the con- |
      trol stream file for all types of problems.  Should  this  occur, |
      NONMEM  may  issue an error, and the user will need to set the NO |
      value with a $SIZES record.

 Constants that may be changed with $SIZES record:

 LTH LVR LVR2 LPAR MMX MAXIDS NO PD MAXOMEG MAXPTHETA

 Consants that are also in prsizes:

 PC PCT PIR PD PAL MAXFCN

 Constants that may not be changed using $SIZES record

 LSTEXT MAXXNAME MAXVRESWRES MAXVRESN MXNAME DIMQ PPR  PW  SD  SCO  SDF
 MAX_EXTRA
