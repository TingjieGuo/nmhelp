<DIV style="position:absolute;top:113;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"><b>1. What This Chapter is About</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">This chapter introduces a computer program called NONMEM. It also introduces two programs that are<br>distributed with NONMEM and make it easier to use: PREDPP and NM-TRAN. The scope of this text<br>itself is described, and suggestions are made for reading it. A somewhat detailed technical description of<br>the components of NONMEM is then given. The ﬁnal section is a list of additional references.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:189;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"><b>2. Introducing NONMEM</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:216;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"><b>2.1. What is NONMEM?</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">NONMEM stands for &quot;Nonlinear Mixed Effects Model.&quot; NONMEM is a computer program, written in<br>FORTRAN 90/95, designed to ﬁt general statistical (nonlinear) regression-type models to data.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:260;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">NONMEM was developed by the NONMEM Project Group at the University of California at San Fran-<br>cisco for analyzing population pharmacokinetic data in particular.† These are data typically collected from<br>clinical studies of pharmaceutic agents, involving the administration of a drug to individuals and the subse-<br>quent observation of drug levels (most often in the blood plasma). Proper modeling of these data involves<br>accounting for both unexplainable inter- and intra-subject effects (random effects), as well as measured<br>concomitant effects (ﬁxed effects). NONMEM allows this mixed effect modeling. Such modeling is espe-<br>cially useful when there are only a few pharmacokinetic measurements from each individual sampled in the<br>population, or when the data collection design varies considerably between these individuals. However,<br>NONMEM is a general program which can be used to ﬁt models to a wide variety of data.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:371;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Like many nonlinear regression programs, NONMEM does not have any &quot;built in&quot; models (such as the lin-<br>ear model) with which it can compute a predicted value given the current values of the regression parame-<br>ters. Instead, NONMEM calls a subroutine having entry name PRED (&quot;prediction&quot;) to obtain a predicted<br>value. PRED also must compute for NONMEM partial derivatives with respect to certain random vari-<br>ables. Depending on the model and the kinds of doses, PRED may be very simple or may be very compli-<br>cated. A user can write his own PRED subroutine. This can be as simple or complicated as is necessary,<br>and may involve calls to its own subprograms.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:467;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"><b>2.2. What is PREDPP?</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:483;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">PREDPP stands for &quot;PRED for Population Pharmacokinetics&quot;. It is a PRED subroutine for use with NON-<br>MEM and is the second major component distributed with NONMEM. Whereas NONMEM is a general<br>nonlinear regression tool, PREDPP is specialized to the kinds of predictions which arise in pharmacokinetic<br>data analysis. It can compute predictions according to many different pharmacokinetic models, according<br>to a great variety of dosing regimens. Almost all the examples in this guide use PREDPP.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:555;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1"><b>2.3. What is NM-TRAN?</b></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:570;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">NM-TRAN stands for &quot;NONMEM Translator&quot;. It is the third major component distributed with NON-<br>MEM. It is a separate, &quot;stand-alone&quot; control language translator and data preprocessor. When NM-TRAN<br>is used, a NONMEM run includes two separate steps: ﬁrst the NM-TRAN step, in which a ﬁle of NM-<br>TRAN records (which begin with &quot;$&quot;) are translated into several NONMEM input ﬁles, and second the<br>NONMEM step itself. All the examples in this guide use NM-TRAN. We strongly recommend its use.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:634;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft4">Note that neither NM-TRAN nor NONMEM-PREDPP run interactively. Files of commands and data are<br>created by means of (say) the operating system editor. Then NM-TRAN and NONMEM are executed,<br>using these ﬁles as input. Figure 1.1 shows the relationship between NONMEM, PREDPP, and NM-<br>TRAN.</span></nobr></DIV>
