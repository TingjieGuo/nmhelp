 MEANING: Choice of Pharmacokinetic Model for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: Option of NM-TRAN $SUBROUTINES record

 USAGE:
 $SUBROUTINES [ADVAN=]ADVAN11

 SAMPLE:
 $SUBROUTINE ADVAN11

 DISCUSSION:
 ADVAN11  is a routine in PREDPP's library which implements the kinetic
 equations for the Three Compartment Linear Model.

 3        Peripheral 2   On        No        Yes       No         No
 4        Output         Off       Yes       No        No         No

 TRANS routines that may be used: TRANS1, TRANS4, TRANS6

 Basic PK parameters with TRANS1:

      K (rate constant of elimination)
      K12 (rate constant from central to peripheral 1)
      K21 (rate constant from peripheral 1 to central)
      K13 (rate constant from central to peripheral 2)
      K31 (rate constant from peripheral 2 to central)

 Basic PK parameters with TRANS4: (See <A HREF="t.htm#trans4">TRANS4</A>).

 Basic PK parameters with TRANS6: (See <A HREF="t.htm#trans6">TRANS6</A>).

 Additional PK parameters:

      S1 - Scale for central compartment (also called SC)
      S2 - Scale for peripheral compartment 1
      S3 - Scale for peripheral compartment 2
      S4 - Scale for output compartment (also called S0)
      F1 - Bioavailability for central compartment
      F2 - Bioavailability for peripheral compartment 1
      F3 - Bioavailability for peripheral compartment 2
      R1 - Rate for central compartment
      R2 - Rate for peripheral compartment 1
      R3 - Rate for peripheral compartment 2
      D1 - Duration for central compartment
      D2 - Duration for peripheral compartment 1
      D3 - Duration for peripheral compartment 2
      ALAG1 - Absorption lag for central compartment
      ALAG2 - Absorption lag for peripheral compartment 1
      ALAG3 - Absorption lag for peripheral compartment 2
      F0 - Output fraction (also called F4, FO)
      XSCALE - Time scale
      MTIME(i) - Model event times

 Steady-state subroutines:  SS11, SS6

 Other required user or library routines:

 Library:  EXP3

 Notes:

 1    Analytical second derivatives used with the Laplacian method  are
      not  obtained with ADVAN11.  Numerical second derivatives must be
      used.

 2    Can be greatly speeded up if calls to PK can  be  limited.   (Use
      CALLFL=1  in  $PK to call once per IR, and use the CALL data item
      to force additional calls  if  and  when  necessary;  e.g.,  when
      covariates used in the PK model change.)
