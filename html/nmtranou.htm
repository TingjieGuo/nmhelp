 MEANING: NM-TRAN output files
 CONTEXT: NONMEM input file

 DISCUSSION:

 NM-TRAN  produces  several  output  files,  several of which are input
 files to NONMEM itself.

 In the first column, the files are listed by the  default  file  names
 supplied  by  constants  in NM-TRAN's ABLOCK routine.  (Some installa-
 tions may use different names for these files.)

 The second column lists the inputs to NM-TRAN that contribute to these
 files.

 The third column indicates how the files are used.

 Note that file FSIZES is a convenient reference for users to view, but |
 is not used.  SUBROUTINE FSIZESR in FSUBS is  what  is  actually  used |
 during the NONMEM run.

                                      the commands that create  the
                                      NONMEM  executable (e.g., the
                                      NMLINK routine).
 FORIG     Abbreviated code, $ABBR    When $ABBR REPLACE  is  used,
                                      this file contains the origi-

 FREPL     Abbreviated code, $ABBR    When $ABBR REPLACE  is  used,
                                      this  file contains the post-
                                      replacement abbreviated code.
 FWORK     Data file                  NM-TRAN (work file)
 FWARN     All                        Warning   and   informational
                                      messages.

           $THETA,  $OMEGA, $SIGMA,
           $SIZES, SIZES.f90

 With NONMEM 7, files FSUBS2 and FSUBS_MU are used by  NMTRAN  as  work
 files during the creation of FSUBS.
