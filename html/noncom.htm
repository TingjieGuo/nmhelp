 MEANING: Global variables in NONMEM
 CONTEXT: User-supplied routines

 DISCUSSION:
 FORTRAN  modules are used to communicate values between various compo-
 nents of the NONMEM system.  They supplement the subroutine arguments.

 1) NONMEM-PRED modules

 These modules contain values that are (for the most part) communicated
 from  PRED  to  NONMEM.   Prior  to  NONMEM 7 these values were COMMON
 blocks.  Following is a list of the MODULE, the (old)  COMMON,  and  a
 description of the variables.

 NMPRD_INT (NMPRD1)
      PRED return code and user message count (IERPRD,NETEXT)

 NMPRD_CHAR (NMPRD2)
      PRED user message (ETEXT)

 NMPRD_INT (NMPRD3)
      "Copying  pass" flag and SAVE region size for NMPRD4 (COMACT,COM-
      SAV)

 NMPRD4P (NMPRD4)
      PRED-defined items for tables and scatterplots

 NMPRD_REAL (NMPRD5)
      Correlation matrix for epsilon's.

 NMPRD_INT (NMPRD6)
      Return code from routine SIMEPS.

 NMPRD_REAL (NMPRD7)
      Simulated etas for tables and scatterplots.

 NMPRD_REAL (NMPRD8)
      PRED's "recursive" flag

 NMPRD_REAL (NMPRD9)
      Data record at ICALL 0, 1 and 3

 NMPR_INT (NMPR10)
      Control information for PRED repetition feature.

 NMPR_INT (NMPR11)
      Flags to override effect of NEW option on $SIMULATION record.

 NMPR_REAL (NMPR12)
      Conditional limits on observation.

 NMPR_REAL (NMPR13)
      Lower limits defining interval datum, and their derivatives.

 NMPR_REAL (NMPR14)
      Upper limits defining interval datum, and their derivatives.

 NMPR_INT (NMPR15)
      Skip control variable.

 NMPR_REAL (NMPR16)
      Parameter values produced during Simulation Step.

 NMPR_INT (NMPR17)
      Flag indicating character of PRED variable F.

 MEM to PRED and other user-supplied routines.

 code and previous examples that may be available from advanced users.
