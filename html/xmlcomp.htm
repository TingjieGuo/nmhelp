 MEANING: XML_COMPARE program
 CONTEXT: NONMEM run

 The  utility  program  xml_compare compares the contents of two NONMEM
 report XML files that are produced by NONMEM.

 USAGE:
 xml_compare myresult1.xml myresult2.xml myprecision.xtl &gt;mydifferences.txt

 where delimiter is {, t s} for {comma tab space}, and  myprecision.xtl
 is  a  precision  specification or control file.  Default delimiter is
 space and default control file is xml_compare.xtl.  It  is  useful  to
 redirect  difference  results  to  a  file,  in this example mydiffer-
 ences.txt.

 The control file can be quite elaborate, but it  allows  specification
 of  various precision values for the many different types of values in
 the NONMEM report XML file, and to ignore certain entries as well.  An
 example  xml_compare.xtl  file  is  in the util directory, and has the
 following contents:

 $IGNORE
 monitor
 elapsed_time
 datetime
 covariance_status
 termination_status
 nonmem(version)
 $PRECISION
 GENERAL=0.2,0.2 OBJ_BAYES=2.0,0.0 OBJ_SAEM=0,100.0
 OBJ_ITS=0,5.0 OBJ_IMP=0,10.0 OBJ_F=0,5.0
 DIAG=0.3,0 OFFDIAG=0,0.5 COR=0.0,0.3 VAR=0.3,0.1 COV=-1.0
 EIGENVALUES=2.0,0 OBJ_DIRECT=0,100.0
 correlation_o=-1.0 INVCOVARIANCE_O=-1 INVCOVARIANCE_D=-1
 etashrink=0,20 epsshrink=0,10
 METHOD=DIRECT ALL=-1
 METHOD=SAEM epsshrink=0,20

 The $IGNORE record will ignore all elements that are listed, or just a
 specific attribute of an element, such as nonmem(version).

 Under the $PRECISION record, a
 GENERAL=R,A

 can be given for most items, where relative is the relative tolerance,
 and absolute is the absolute tolerance.  Following the GENERAL  speci-
 fication, tolerances may be specified for other items.

 Two items of identical element and attributes are compared between the
 two files, where the equation for comparison is, between  value  X  of
 xml file 1 and value Y of xml file 2,

 ABS(X-Y)&gt;R*MAX(ABS(X),ABS(Y))+A

 The  OBJ_BAYES is given a special test, as it has a standard deviation
 with it:

 STD(X,Y)=SQRT(STD(X)2+ STD(Y)2)
 ABS(X-Y)&gt;R*STD(X,Y)+A
 In the above example OBJ_BAYES=(2,0) means that if the Bayes objective
 functions  in the two files differ by more than 2 standard deviations,
 then the difference is noted.

 To ignore an item for comparison, specify -1.   To  specify  an  exact
 comparison,  use  0,0.   To refer to a particular optimization method,
 then enter METHOD=SAEM for example, and  thereafter,  all  entries  of
 items pertain to that estimation method, until METHOD is changed.

 The METHOD attribute may have one of the following settings:

 FOCE, ITS, IMP, SAEM, DIRECT, BAYES

 For the total list of items, and their scope:

 See INTRODUCTION  TO NONMEM 7, xml_compare Utility Program and its Use
 for Installation Qualification

 Because of the versatility of selecting which items are to be compared
 and with what precision, the xml_compare program can be used for batch
 processing installation qualification procedures, in comparing  NONMEM
 results  of  a test run against a reference run.  All results given in
 the standard NONMEM output file are also reported in the XML file.
