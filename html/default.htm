 MEANING: Default compartments for kinetic models with PREDPP
 CONTEXT: NONMEM data set

 DISCUSSION:

  The  prediction  computed  by  PREDPP is a scaled drug amount in some
 compartment called the observation compartment.  Every dose  is  input
 into some dose compartment.

 With  every  kinetic  model there are designated a default observation
 compartment and a default dose compartment. For some  kinetic  models,
 these  designations  are  built into the model definition; for others,
 these designations are given by the user in the user subroutine  MODEL
 (or in $MODEL abbreviated code).

 Unless  otherwise specified on an observation event record by means of
 the compartment data item (CMT), the observation compartment is  taken
 to  be the default observation compartment. Unless otherwise specified
 on a dose event record by means of the compartment data item, the dose
 compartment is taken to be the default dose compartment.

 The  models  for  which  default  designations are built-in are listed
 here.  The numbers are the compartment numbers.
