 MEANING: PRIOR subroutine
 CONTEXT: User-supplied subroutine; replaces a NONMEM dummy routine

 USAGE:
      SUBROUTINE PRIOR (ICALL,CNT)
      USE SIZES, ONLY: ISIZE,DPSIZE
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE), INTENT(IN) :: ICALL
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE),   INTENT(IN OUT) :: CNT

 DISCUSSION:
 The user-written PRIOR subroutine allows a penalty function based on a
 frequency prior to be specified and  added  to  the  -2log  likelihood
 function  (Gisleskog  et al, JPP, 2002, p. 473-505).  This serves as a
 constraint on the estimates of THETA, OMEGA, and SIGMA and thus  as  a
 way for stable estimates to be obtained with insufficient data.

 When  the  Simulation  Step is implemented, THETA and OMEGA, and SIGMA
 may also be simulated (along with etas and epsilons, should  any  such
 appear  in  the model and have nonzero-variances) in the PRIOR subrou-
 tine (See <A HREF="p.htm#prior_simulation:_parameters">PRIOR_Simulation:_Parameters</A>).  However, this  need  not  be
 done  (simply execute a return in PRIOR at ICALL=4), in which case the
 values for THETA, OMEGA, and SIGMA used in the simulation are the val-
 ues  given  in  the NONMEM control stream or input Model Specification
 File.

 Input argument:

  ICALL
      Similar to ICALL for PRED subroutine.
      Possible values: 0, 1, 2, and 4.
      In a multiple problem run, PRIOR is called with ICALL=1 only with
      the first problem.

 Output argument:

  CNT CNT is the penalty term.

 Other Inputs:

 Other  inputs  are  available  to  PRIOR  in NONMEM read-only modules.
 (See <A HREF="n.htm#nonmem_modules">NONMEM_modules</A>).

 NONMEM Utility Routines:

 PRIOR  may  call   NONMEM   utility   routines,   NWPRI   and   TNPRI.
 (See <A HREF="n.htm#nwpri">nwpri</A>, <A HREF="t.htm#tnpri">tnpri</A>).  E.g.,

      SUBROUTINE PRIOR (ICALL,CNT)
      USE SIZES, ONLY: DPSIZE,ISIZE
      REAL (KIND=DPSIZE) :: CNT
      REAL (KIND=DPSIZE) :: PLEV
      INTEGER (KIND=ISIZE) :: ICALL
      NTHETA=3
      NETA=3
      NEPS=1
      NTHP=2
      NETP=2
      NEPP=1
      PLEV=0
      CALL NWPRI (NTHETA,NETA,NEPS,NTHP,NETP,NEPP,NPEXP,ITYP,PLEV, &
                  NSAM,ISS,CNT)
      RETURN
      END

 NWPRI  and TNPRI compute particular types of penalty functions.  NWPRI
 computes a function based on a frequency prior that has a multivariate
 normal  form  for  THETA, and also, in the case of population data, an
 inverse Wishart form  for  OMEGA  (independent  from  the  normal  for
 THETA).   When  used  during  a  Simulation Step, it produces a random
 value of THETA and a random value of OMEGA from the  frequency  prior.
 The  prior  information  is  entered manually into the control stream.
 This prior is especially useful for a subjective  specification  of  a
 penalty function.  (See <A HREF="n.htm#nwpri">nwpri</A>, <A HREF="t.htm#tnpri">tnpri</A>).

 Model parameters may be constrained in various ways.  Those parameters
 whose values are not fixed are transformed  to  new  parameters  whose
 values are not at all constrained a priori (the "unconstrained parame-
 ters", or UCP).  TNPRI computes a penalty function  based  on  a  fre-
 quency  prior  that  has a multivariate normal form for all UCP.  When
 used during a Simulation Step, it produces a random value of the  vec-
 tor  of  all model parameters (whose values are not fixed).  The prior
 information is found in an input model specification file, and it  has
 been  automatically  stored  there  as  part of a NONMEM analysis of a
 prior data set.  (See <A HREF="$.htm#$msfi">$msfi</A>, model_specification_file).  This prior is
 especially  useful  for  an empirical specification of a penalty func-
 tion.  (See <A HREF="t.htm#tnpri">TNPRI</A>).

 The $PRIOR statement can be used instead of a PRIOR subroutine.
 (See <A HREF="$.htm#$prior">$prior.ctl</A>).
