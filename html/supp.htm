 MEANING: SUPP subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 USAGE:
      USE SIZES, ONLY:: ISIZE
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE):: IE,IC
       ...
      CALL SUPP (IE,IC)

 DISCUSSION:
 The  NONMEM  utility  routine SUPP is used to suppress portions of the
 NONMEM output report.  SUPP may be called only when ICALL is 0, 1,  or
 3.

 Input argument:

  IE  An  integer variable or integer constant.  If the value is 1, the
      output from the Estimation Step is not  included  in  the  output
      report.

  IC  An  integer variable or integer constant.  If the value is 1, the
      output from the Covariance Step is not  included  in  the  output
      report.

 SUPP  is  typically used during simulation with numerous sub-problems.
 A user-supplied INFN routine, or similar code in a user-supplied  PRED
 routine,  presumably calculates and prints summary statistics based on
 the final parameter estimates, etc.  Printed  values  from  each  sub-
 problem  are  of  little  interest and may be suppressed to reduce the
 size of the report file.

 When IE=1, pages with these headings are suppressed:

 MINIMUM VALUE OF OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
 FINAL PARAMETER ESTIMATE

 When IC=1, pages with these headings are suppressed:

 STANDARD ERROR OF ESTIMATE
 COVARIANCE MATRIX OF ESTIMATE
 CORRELATION MATRIX OF ESTIMATE
 INVERSE COVARIANCE MATRIX OF ESTIMATE

 The option PRINT=0 of the $ESTIMATION record is used to  suppress  the
 Intermediate   printout  from  the  Estimation  Step  ("MONITORING  OF
 SEARCH:...")

 EXAMPLES OF USAGE:

 CALL SUPP(1,1)

 This suppress both Estimation and Covariance Step output.
