 MEANING: NCONTR subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 This feature is not fully documented.  The interested user may be able
 to obtain more information by studying  the  appropriate  sections  of
 NONMEM  code and previous examples that may be available from advanced
 users.

 USAGE:
      USE SIZES, ONLY: ISIZE,DPSIZE
      INTEGER(KIND=ISIZE) :: IER1,IER2,L2R
      REAL(KIND=DPSIZE)   :: CNT
       ...
      CALL NCONTR (CNT,IER1,IER2,L2R)

 DISCUSSION:
 NCONTR is a NONMEM utility routine.  It computes the normal-based con-
 tribution  to the objective function from the data from a single indi-
 vidual ("L1") record.

 NCONTR may be called by a user-supplied CONTR.   NCONTR  can  be  used
 when  eta  is  from  a  normal  distribution with mean 0 and variance-
 covariance OMEGA.  It can be used with population data.  It should not
 be used with single-subject data.

 Output argument:

  CNT Contribution to -2log likelihood for data from the L1 record

  IER1
      IER1 return codes:

       1   HESSIAN  OF  OBJ. FUNC. FOR COMPUTING SOME CONDITIONAL ESTI-
           MATE IS SINGULAR, IF LAPLACIAN IS NOT USED,  OR  NONPOSITIVE
           DEFINITE, IF LAPLACIAN IS USED.

       2   ETA-DERIVATIVE OF SOME CONDITIONAL -2LOG LIKELIHOOD VALUE IS
           TOO LARGE

       3   NUMERICAL HESSIAN OF OBJ. FUNC. FOR  COMPUTING  SOME  CONDI-
           TIONAL ESTIMATE IS NON POSITIVE DEFINITE

       11  IF CCONTR IS NOT USED AND F = PREDICTION, SOME INTRAINDIVID-
           UAL VARIANCE-COVARIANCE IS SINGULAR.

           IF CCONTR IS NOT USED AND F = LIKELIHOOD,  SOME  CONDITIONAL
           LIKELIHOOD VALUE IS NEGLIGIBLE.

       12  IF  CCONTR  IS  NOT USED AND F = PREDICTION, WEIGHTED SUM OF
           "SQUARED" INDIVIDUAL RESIDUALS IS INFINITE.

       10+ IF CCONTR IS USED, 10 IS ADDED TO A NONZERO  VALUE  OF  IER1
           FROM CCONTR.

  IER2
      0 if error-recovery is to be implemented when IER1 is nonzero.
      1 if NONMEM is to stop when IER1 is nonzero.

   L2R
      Index of L2 record giving rise to error condition.

 Other inputs:
      NCONTR  obtains all its inputs from NONMEM read-only global vari-
      ables.
