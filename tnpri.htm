 MEANING: TNPRI subroutine
 CONTEXT: NONMEM utility routine

 USAGE:
      USE SIZES, ONLY: ISIZE,DPSIZE
      INTEGER (KIND=ISIZE) :: IFND,MODE,ITYP,NSAM,ISS,IVAR
      REAL (KIND=DPSIZE) :: PLEV
      REAL (KIND=DPSIZE) :: CNT
      REAL (KIND=ISIZE) :: ICALL
      CALL TNPRI (IFND,MODE,ITYP,PLEV,NSAM,ISS,IVAR,CNT)

 DISCUSSION:

 The  model  parameters  THETA,  OMEGA and SIGMA parameters may be con-
 strained in various ways.  Those parameters whose values are not fixed
 are  transformed in a one-to-one manner to parameters whose values are
 not at all constrained a priori (the  "unconstrained  parameters",  or
 UCP).   The  user-written  PRIOR  subroutine allows a penalty function
 based on a frequency prior to be specified  and  added  to  the  -2log
 likelihood  function  (Gisleskog  et al, JPP, 2002, p. 473-505).  This
 function serves as a constraint on the estimates of THETA,  OMEGA  and
 SIGMA  and  thus  as  a  way  for stable estimates to be obtained with
 insufficient data.  TNPRI may be called by  PRIOR.   (See <A HREF="p.htm#prior">prior</A>).   It
 computes a penalty function based on a frequency prior that has a mul-
 tivariate normal form for all the UCP.  The one-to-one  transformation
 between  THETA,  OMEGA and SIGMA and the UCP induces a frequency prior
 for THETA, OMEGA and SIGMA itself.  This latter  form  is  called  the
 "transformed normal" form.

 Both  forms  have  the same parameters, which are called "hyperparame-
 ters".  The values of the hyperparameters are produced  with  a  prior
 NONMEM  problem  (called  the "prior problem") used to analyze a prior
 data set.  Thus the frequency prior  has  an  empirical  nature.   The
 prior problem should have implemented the Covariance Step (the Estima-
 tion Step could have been implemented  in  yet  an  earlier  problem).
 Whenever a problem implements the Covariance Step and a model specifi-
 cation file has been output, this file automatically contains informa-
 tion  -  referred  to as the "prior information", and including values
 for the hyperparameters - which can be used when TNPRI is  used  in  a
 subsequent problem.

 The abilty to use TNPRI suggests that with any serious analysis under-
 taken in the future, though it may not be necessary to save  the  data
 that  were analyzed, a model specification file should be produced and
 safely stored along with a control stream showing the particulars that
 gave  rise  to  this  file.  There is a special way to input the prior
 information from the model specification file for its use with a  sub-
 sequent application of TNPRI.  (Alternatively, a NONMEM control stream
 may consist of multiple problems, where one problem  (A)  uses  TNPRI,
 and  the  prior  problem appears as an earlier problem (B) in the same
 control stream.  The prior information from problem B can be available
 to problem A without the need to use a model specification file.)

 When  TNPRI  is  used  during  a Simulation Step, it produces a random
 value of the vector of all model  parameters  (whose  values  are  not
 fixed  in the parameter records) from the frequency prior.  (See Simu-
 lation example).  (See <A HREF="t.htm#tnpri_examples">tnpri example</A>).  If TNPRI  is  used   during  a
 given  problem at ICALL=2, it should not be used during the same prob-
 lem at ICALL=4, and vice-versa.

 TNPRI may be used at ICALL=0 or ICALL=1, in which case only the values
 of  its  input arguments are checked.  If it is not used at ICALL=0 or
 ICALL=1, then the first time it is used at ICALL=2 or ICALL=4,  check-
 ing will occur.

 Do not use TNPRI with the new $ESTIMATION methods of NONMEM 7.

 Input argument:

  IFND

      0:  Indicates that a prior problem has been specified either ear-
      lier in the current control stream or in a previously run control
      stream,  and  that  this problem has output a model specification
      file.  The prior information will have automatically been  stored
      in  the  model specification file.  The prior problem should have
      implemented the  Covariance  Step  (which  should  have  computed
      either  the  default  variance-covariance matrix or two times the
      inverse of the R matrix).  The current control stream should con-
      sist  of at least two problems: the problem that uses TNPRI and a
      preceeding problem that serves only to input the  prior  informa-
      tion from the model specification file, such as the following:

           $PROB   READ THE MODEL SPECIFICATION FILE
           $DATA data
           $INPUT ID TIME AMT DV TYPE SS II
           $MSFI msf1  ONLYREAD

      This simple problem (B) should be the last problem in the current
      control stream that appears before the problem using TNPRI (prob-
      lem  (A))  and  inputs  a  model specification file.  The problem
      specification should not include any task  records,  but  it  may
      include  e.g.  a  $SUBROUTINES record and/or abbreviated code, if
      problem B is the first problem in the control stream,  and  these
      elements  will  be needed for a subsequent problem.  If problem A
      inputs a model specification file msf2, any prior information  in
      msf2 will be ignored.  If problem A outputs a model specification
      file msf3 and implements the Covariance Step, the prior  informa-
      tion stored in msf3 is based not only on the data being analyzed,
      but also on the prior information in msf1.

      1: Indicates that along with  the  current  problem  (with  which
      TNPRI  is being used), a prior problem has been specified earlier
      in the same control stream.  The prior problem is taken to be the
      last  problem  in the control stream that appears before the cur-
      rent one and that implements the Covariance  Step  (which  should
      have  computed  either  the default variance-covariance matrix or
      two times the inverse of the R matrix).

  MODE
      Discussion:  In any NONMEM problem specification, all of the last
      contiguously listed parameters on the $THETA record, whose values
      on this record are fixed, and assuming the value of the very last
      parameter  itself  is fixed, are called the "terminal fixed THETA
      parameters".  There may be  no  such  parameters.   E.g.  if  the
      $THETA record is

      $THETA 3.1 FIX 6.3 .01 400 FIX 7 FIX 90 FIX

      then  THETA  parameters  4-6 are the terminal fixed THETA parame-
      ters.  If the record is

      $THETA 3.1 FIX 6.3 .01 400 FIX 7 FIX 90

      then there are no terminal fixed THETA  parameters,  because  the
      value 90 of the very last parameter is not fixed.  Similarly, all
      the last contiguous fixed parameters in OMEGA  (SIGMA),  assuming
      the  values  in the very last block set are fixed, are called the
      "terminal fixed OMEGA (SIGMA)  parameters".  (Recall  that  in  a
      diagonal $OMEGA record, all the values form separate block sets.)

      There are some rules concerning the parameter records of a NONMEM
      control stream that relate the parameters of the prior problem to
      those of the current problem:

      I.  With  the exception of the terminal fixed THETA parameters in
      the prior problem, which are altogether ignored  in  the  current
      problem,  the  THETA  parameters of the prior problem must be the
      first THETA parameters listed in the $THETA record of the current
      problem, whether or not their values are fixed in the prior prob-
      lem.

      II. The order of these  first  THETA  parameters  on  the  $THETA
      record must be the same as that in the $THETA record of the prior
      problem.   The initial estimates of these parameters need not  be
      the same, but any upper or lower bounds must be the same.

      III.   Among the first THETA parameters, values that are fixed on
      the $THETA record of the prior problem must also be fixed on  the
      $THETA  record  of  the current problem, although the values need
      not be the same, but not vice-versa; see  discussion  below  con-
      cerning parameter interpretation.

      IV.   THETA  parameters  peculiar  to  the current problem may be
      listed at the end of the $THETA record of  the  current  problem,
      after  the  parameters that are shared between the prior and cur-
      rent problems.

      E.g. if the $THETA record with the prior problem is

      $THETA 3.1 FIX 6.3 (0,.01) 400 FIX 7 FIX 90 FIX

      then the $THETA record with the current problem may be

      $THETA 10  FIX 7.0 (0,.03) 80.2 100.8

      in which case the values 80.2 and 100.8 are  the  values  of  the
      THETA  parameters  that are peculiar to the current problem.  The
      2nd and 3rd parameters are used in both prior and  current  prob-
      lems,  but  have different values in the two problems.  The first
      parameter may be used in the current problem, in which  case  its
      value is fixed to 10.

      The same rules apply to the $OMEGA and $SIGMA records of the cur-
      rent problem.

      A model specification file from a previous instance of  the  cur-
      rent  problem  may  be used, as usual, providing that if with the
      previous instance, parameter records were used, the  above  rules
      were followed.

      Parameter  Interpretation:   The  prior  information concerns all
      parameters appearing in the prior problem whose  values  are  not
      fixed  in  that  problem.   However,  a parameter with a nonfixed
      value in the prior problem may have a fixed value in the  current
      problem, and this gives rise to some ambiguity.  Such a parameter
      may have an interpretation in  the  prior  problem  that  remains
      unchanged in the current problem.  Then it needs to be identified
      as a "shared parameter", in which case, because the value of  the
      parameter  is  fixed  with the current model, the frequency prior
      needs to be adjusted in order to approximate the -2  log  likeli-
      hood  function  for  the  prior  data when the parameter value is
      regarded as being fixed in the prior model.  (or  when  TNPRI  is
      being called in the Simulated Step, in order to use a conditional
      prior distribution,  given  the  parameter  value  is  the  fixed
      value).   A shared parameter may not actually be used in the cur-
      rent problem, but the salient point  is  that  with  the  current
      problem,  the interpretation of this parameter remains unchanged.
      Alternatively, the parameter's interpretation may change  in  the
      current problem.  Then it needs to be identified as a "prior-spe-
      cific" parameter, in which case if it is  actually  used  in  the
      current  model,  its  value  will be the fixed value, but for the
      purpose of applying the prior information, TNPRI will regard this
      parameter  as one specific to the prior model.  The MODE argument
      concerns this distinction.

      0:  All parameters with a nonfixed value in the prior problem but
      a  fixed  value  in  the  current problem are identified as being
      prior-specific parameters.  However, the final estimates of these
      parameters are their fixed values.

      1:  All parameters with a nonfixed value in the prior problem but
      a fixed value in the current  problem  are  identified  as  being
      prior-specific  parameters.   If  the  Estimation  Step is imple-
      mented, the final estimate for such a parameter is the  same  one
      that  would  result from not fixing the value of the parameter in
      the current problem and letting it be  estimated,  assuming  that
      the  parameter  is  not  at  all used in the current model.  This
      value will be similar to the final estimate of the  parameter  in
      the  prior  problem.   (A difference from this prior estimate may
      result, reflecting the fact that if there is a sequence  of  mod-
      els, each a submodel of the one succeeding it, then the data used
      to fit the last of the models may bear on a parameter peculiar to
      the  first  model,  if only slightly.)  If indeed the parameter's
      value were not fixed, but the parameter's estimate obtained along
      with the estimates of the non-prior-specific parameters, then the
      latter estimates and the minimum value of the objective  function
      would  be  unchanged, but the search for the parameter's estimate
      would require additional computer time.   With the value  MODE=1,
      in  fact,  the  parameter's estimate is obtainable posthoc, after
      the search, and this additional computer time is saved.  The out-
      put  from  the  Covariance  Step  includes  all the usual type of
      information about the estimators of the prior-specific parameters
      along  with  that  about the estimators of the non-prior-specific
      parameters.  However, note that  an  output  model  specification
      file  will  not  contain  any  information about the estimates of
      prior-specific parameters.

      2:  All parameters with a nonfixed value in the prior problem but
      a  fixed  value  in  the  current problem are identified as being
      shared parameters (i.e. the frequency prior  is  adjusted).   The
      final estimates of these parameters are their fixed values.

  ITYP
      Relevant  only if TNPRI is called during a Simulation Step.  Val-
      ues are:

      0: The value of  the  UCP  (unconstrained  parameter)  vector  is
      obtained from simple random sampling.

      1:  Within  the  given problem, TNPRI is to be called a specified
      number (NSAM) of times to obtain this number of different  values
      of  the  UCP  vector.   These values are obtained by generating a
      Latin sample of size NSAM  from  equiprobable  partitions  of  an
      ellipsoid  in UCP space (hyper-ellipsoidal sampling), followed by
      sampling a point "uniformly" from each  partition.   This  scheme
      may  be used, for example, when the problem has NSAM subproblems,
      in which case, TNPRI would be called NSAM times, once  each  time
      during  the  problem  when ICALL=4, and at each of these calls, a
      different random value of the UCP vector will be produced.

      2: Just as with value 1, but the NSAM values are obtained by gen-
      erating  a Latin sample of size NSAM from equiprobable partitions
      of an ellipsoid in UCP space (hyper-ellipsoidal  sampling),  fol-
      lowed by taking the "center point" of each partition.

      In all three cases, a value of the UCP vector is transformed into
      THETA-OMEGA-SIGMA space.

      After each call to NWPRI, the simulated values for  THETA,  OMEGA
      and SIGMA may be found in global variables and thus they are com-
      municated  directly  to  NONMEM.   (See PRIOR_Simulation:_Parame-
      ters).

  PLEV
      When  TNPRI  is being used at ICALL=0 or 1, but TNPRI will not be
      used at ICALL=4 (i.e. during the Simulation Step), PLEV should be
      set  to 0.  When it is being used at ICALL=2, PLEV should also be
      set to 0.  When TNPRI is being used at ICALL=0 or 1 and will also
      be  used  at  ICALL=4,  or when it is being used at ICALL=4, then
      PLEV must be set to a fraction strictly less than 1, e.g.  0.999. |
      PLEV  is  double precision with NONMEM 7, and is single precision |
      with NONMEM VI.

      A UCP value will actually be obtained using  a  truncated  multi-
      variate  normal  distribution, i.e. from an ellipsoidal region R1
      over which only a fraction of mass of the  normal  occurs.   This
      fraction  is given by PLEV.  Simple random sampling occurs in R1.
      Latin sampled partitions are partitions of R1.

  NSAM
      Relevant only if TNPRI is called during a Simulation Step.   Con-
      sider  two cases.  a) Latin hyper-ellipsoid sampling is used with
      ITYP=1, or b) simple random sampling along  with  the  adjustment
      for small sample correlation effect is used (see next input argu-
      ment).  In case a) NSAM should equal the exact  total  number  of
      different  values of the parameter vector that must eventually be
      produced over the entire NONMEM problem.  In case b) NSAM  should
      be no less than this number.

   ISS
      Relevant  only  if  TNPRI  is called during a Simulation Step.  A
      value of the UCP vector is obtained by  first  sampling  a  value
      from  the standard multivariate normal distribution - called here
      "the standard value" and then transforming this value to one from
      the  appropriate  multivariate normal.  The correlation matrix of
      the standard normal is the identity matrix.  When NSAM is  small,
      the estimated correlation matrix from the sampled standard values
      might not be quite close to the identity matrix -  this  is  here
      called "the small sample correlation effect".

      1: An adjustment is made for the small sample correlation effect,
      by first transforming the NSAM standard  values  altogether  into
      new  values  which  are  very nearly standard multivariate normal
      values and such that the sample correlation matrix of  these  new
      values is exactly the identity matrix.

      0: No adjustment is made for the small sample correlation effect.

  IVAR
      Relevant  only if TNPRI is called during a Simulation Step.  When
      TNPRI simulates a parameter value, this value is that of an esti-
      mate  of  the parameter from possible data under the prior model,
      and this simulation is based on  asymptotic  statistical  theory.
      The  partial derivatives comprising the R and S matrices referred
      to below are taken with respect to the UCP (See <A HREF="c.htm#covariance">covariance</A>).  The
      possible values of IVAR are:

      0:  The  variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate normal on
      the UCP is taken to be two times the inverse  R  matrix  obtained
      from  the  prior problem.  This could be appropriate if the esti-
      mated asymptotic variance-covariance matrix from the prior  prob-
      lem is also based only on the R matrix.

      1:  The  variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate normal on
      the UCP is taken to be Rinv*S*Rinv matrix from the prior problem.

      2: The variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate  normal  on
      the UCP is taken to be S matrix from the prior problem. (NM75)

      Briefly:
      IVAR=0: Uses Rinv of a former problem.
      IVAR=1: Uses Rinv*S*Rinv of a former problem
      IVAR=2: Uses S of a former problem.

 Output argument:

  CNT Relevant only if TNPRI is called at ICALL=2.  CNT is the penalty.
