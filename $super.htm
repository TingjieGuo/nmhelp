 MEANING: Identifies the start of a NONMEM Superproblem
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN Control Record

 USAGE:
 $SUPER  [SCOPE=n1] [ITERATIONS=n2]
         [NOPRINT|PRINT]

 SAMPLE:
 $SUPER     SCOPE=2 ITERATIONS=10

 DISCUSSION:
 Optional.

 OPTIONS:

 SCOPE=n1
      Number  of  problems  in the superproblem.  Required.  Must be at
      least 1.

 ITERATIONS=n2
      Number of iterations of the superproblem.  Required.  Must be  at
      least 2.  ITERATIONS may also be coded NITERATIONS.

 NOPRINT
      NONMEM  printout displaying the input information for each of the
      problems of the superproblem will be generated  only  during  the
      first iteration.  This is the default.

 PRINT
      NONMEM  printout displaying the input information for each of the
      problems of the superproblem will be generated during all  itera-
      tions.

 To define a sequence of problems as a superproblem, precede the $PROB-
 LEM record of the first problem of the sequence with a $SUPER  record.
 More than one $SUPER problem can be present in the control stream, but
 the level of nesting can be at most 2.

 The pattern for nested super problems is                               |

 $SUPER SCOPE=s1                                                        |
 $PROBLEM 1                                                             |
  ...                                                                   |
 $PROBLEM n                                                             |
 $SUPER SCOPE=s2                                                        |
 $PROBLEM n+1                                                           |
  ...                                                                   |
 $PROBLEM n+m                                                           |

 The second super problem must be totally contained with in the first.  |

 n &gt;= 1 and m &gt;= 1 is required (each $SUPER  problem  must  contain  at |
 least one $PROBLEM).                                                   |

 If  s1  &gt;  n,  then  the scope of the first $SUPER includes the second |
 $SUPER, and the scope of the second must be entirely contained  within |
 the scope of the first: s1 &gt;= n+s2.
