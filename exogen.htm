 DISCUSSION:

 In  this  example,  an  oral  "drug" is given exogenously, and it also
 exists as an endogenous substance. There is an unknown dosing  history
 prior  to  the  observation  period  (i.e., prior to time zero).  This
 example illustrates how three sources of drug  can  be  modeled:  pre-
 existing endogenous drug, pre-existing drug from an unknown prior dos-
 ing history, and drug from known doses.  Any combination of the  three
 could be modeled without the others.

 The rate of endogenous drug production is assumed to be constant, with
 no feedback control of production. Thus endogenous drug is at  steady-
 state,  and,  with linear kinetics, its effect is simply to add a con-
 stant increment to exogenous drug  in  the  sampled  compartment  (the
 increment is modeled as theta(7)).

 For  the drug with unknown dosing history, it is assumed that the sub-
 ject is at steady state with respect to this drug.  This part of total
 drug  is  modeled  by a steady state infusion dose into the depot com-
 partment, ending at time 0, and having an unknown rate. The result  of
 the  SS  dose is to introduce drug into all compartments of the system
 (not just the central compartment) because it is distributed  through-
 out  the  system  and  is subject to elimination from the system.  The
 unknown rate is modeled as theta(5).  NONMEM will adjust  theta(5)  to
 best  fit  not only the "baseline" observation at time 0, but also the
 later observations.

 Note that if samples are not taken sufficiently long after the time of
 the last dose ( &gt; 4 half-lives), then theta(7) and theta(5) may not be
 separately identifiable.  Note that  the  value  of  theta(7)  may  be
 determined  by the residual concentration after all exogenous drug has
 disappeared.

 A combined additive and ccv error model  is  used.   Theta(8)  is  the
 ratio of the C.V. of the proportional component to the standard devia-
 tion of the additive component.

 Any ADVAN/TRANS combination could be used.  Population data could also
 be modeled in this manner, with eta variables in the $PK block.

   W=(1+THETA(8)*THETA(8)*FP*FP)**.5
   Y=FP+W*ERR(1)

 Note  that,  if  there are other doses into the depot compartment with
 modeled rates, it is necessary to assign a value to R1  conditionally.
 E.g.,

  IF (TIME.EQ.0) THEN
     R1=THETA(5)  ; rate for SS infusion record at time 0
  ELSE
     R1=....; rate of other kind of dose
  ENDIF

 Note  also  that the combined additive and ccv error model can also be
 modeled using two random variables:

 Y = F*(1+ERR(1)) + ERR(2)

 A fragment of the data follows.  Record 1 specifies  the  SS  infusion
 for  the  pre-existing drug, which ends at time 0.  Record 2 gives the
 baseline observation.  Record 3 specifies an oral bolus dose.   Record
 4 gives an observation.
