 MEANING: REPEAT (RPT_) data item
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 USAGE:
 $INPUT ... RPT_ ...

 DISCUSSION:
 RPT_  labels  NONMEM's  repeat  data  item.   The  repeat data item is
 optional.  It is used as an alternative way to mark a data record as a
 repetition  base.   (For another way of doing this, global "Repetition
 Variables" RPTI,RPTO,RPTON,PRDFL may be used.)

 Permissible values of RPT_ are:

 0    The data record is not a repetition base.

 n (n between 1 and 5)
      The data record is marked as a "repetition base  with  value  n",
      i.e.   as the first of a series of contiguous records of the cur-
      rent individual  record  (with  single-subject  data,  contiguous
      records of the data set) which may be repeated.
      See repeatf.ctl in the examples directory.                        |
