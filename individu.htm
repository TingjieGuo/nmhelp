 MEANING: A data analysis unit
 CONTEXT: NONMEM input/output

 DISCUSSION:
 Data to be analyzed with NONMEM are often population data, by which is
 meant multiple data arising from each of a number of individual units.
 Individuals are typically persons, but they may be any other appropri-
 ate units, such as families, geographic  localities,  etc.   Data  are
 regarded as being statistically independent from unit to unit.

 With  NONMEM, there are two nested levels of random effects, The first
 level applies to individuals;  different individuals are  regarded  as
 having  different  realizations of level-one random effects.  A second
 level of random effects applies to the observations from each individ-
 ual;  different  (univariate) observations are regarded as having dif-
 ferent realizations of level-two randoms effects, but the  same  real-
 ization of level-one random effects.

 The  data  from an individual is given in the data set by a contiguous
 group of data records, with one observation on each data  record,  and
 all  data records having the same identification (ID) data item.  This
 group of data records is called the individual  record,  or  level-one
 (L1)  record.  (Do not confuse a data record, which is one record in a |
 data file, with an  individual  record,  which  is  a  group  of  data |
 records.)

 Data  to  be analyzed may be single-subject data.  These are data that
 appear to require at most one level  of  random  effects.   (In  fact,
 there are population data which require only one level of the two NON-
 MEM levels of random effects, along with  a  second  level  of  random
 effects which may be expressed in a way that is transparent to NONMEM.
 This type of situation is communicated in such a way that NONMEM  does
 not  mistake these data for single-subject data.)  Such data may actu-
 ally arise physically from different individual units, or individuals.
 Indeed, when they do, they may even be comprised of multiple data from
 different units,  e.g.  pairs  of  plasma  and  saliva  concentrations
 obtained  at the same time point, each from a number of different sub-
 jects.  However, if as with this example, only  one  level  of  random
 effects is needed, these data are nonetheless considered to be single-
 subject data.  The data are regarded as being  statistically  indepen-
 dent  from unit to unit.  When single-subject data indeed arise physi-
 cally from the same subject, the data can also be grouped  into  indi-
 vidual  units  such  that the data are regarded as being statistically
 independent from unit to unit.  These units are also called "individu-
 als".   As an example, there may be pairs of plasma and saliva concen-
 trations from the same subject.  More  precisely,  NM-TRAN  recognizes
 population data to be data that do not qualify as single-subject data.

 NONMEM  counts the number of distinct individuals in the data set, and
 reports this count as a check.

 E.g.,
 TOT. NO. OF INDIVIDUALS:  166

 NONMEM 7 also reports how the data is to be analyzed:                  |

 ANALYSIS TYPE: SINGLE-SUBJECT                                          |
 ANALYSIS TYPE: POPULATION                                              |
 ANALYSIS TYPE: POPULATION WITH UNCONSTRAINTED ETAS                     |

 Population analysis with unconstrained etas is new with NONMEM 7,  and |
 can be used to analyze a population data set as  separate individuals. |
 OMEGA diagonal values are fixed to a special value 1.0E+06.            |

 See Guide Introduction_7 "Analyzing Single-subject data as  Population |
 with Unconstrained etas".                                              |
